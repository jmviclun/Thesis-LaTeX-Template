@article{Aerov2012,
abstract = {A Flory-Huggins type lattice approach is used to describe theoretically a heterogeneous mixture composed of an ionic liquid (IL) and a nonionic liquid (nIL). It is analyzed, how the behavior of the system depends on the difference in the affinities of the cations and the anions to the neutral molecules (i.e., on the "amphiphilicity" of the IL with respect to the nIL). It is proved that if the difference in the affinities is not large, two macrophases coexist in the mixture; if the difference exceeds a certain threshold value, the mixture becomes microheterogeneous: depending on its composition, it can turn either into ion clusters dispersed over the phase having low concentration of ions, or into clusters of neutral molecules dispersed over the phase having high concentration of ions. If the system is not close to the critical point, the ion clusters can be only small: the maximal ratio of their diameter to an ion diameter is of the order of ten; however, the clusters of nonionic molecules can be large, if the difference in the affinities has a certain value. It is predicted also that cavities can nucleate inside an IL, and clusters of ions can appear in a saturated vapor of an IL. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics. [doi: 10.1063/1.3670016]},

abstract = {In this work we report on the evolution of the structure of two model ionic liquid families, N-alkyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium (Pyr1n-TFSI) and 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium (CnMIm-TFSI) (n = 3, 4, 6 and 8) both containing the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI) anion, upon the addition of LiTFSI using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The introduction of a lithium salt (Li-salt) tunes the interactions through the substitution of the large cation in the ionic liquid with the small and charge localized lithium ion, thus increasing the coulombic contribution from ion-ion interactions. We find that the introduction of lithium ions results in a restructuring of the polar groups in the ionic liquids. These changes are manifested as an increase in the correlation lengths related to charge alternation of the ions and a more disordered structure. This restructuring is interpreted as a reconfiguration of the anions as they coordinate to the small and ionic lithium. In contrast, the length scale of the mesoscopic heterogeneities related to the clustering of alkyl chains is virtually unchanged with lithium doping. Moreover, the correlation corresponding to alkyl chain domains becomes more well defined with increasing salt concentration, suggesting that Li-salt doping, i.e. an increased columbic interaction in the system, promotes clustering of the alkyl tails.},

abstract = {This work presents the vapor-liquid equilibrium and the liquid-liquid equilibrium phase behavior and associated thermodynamic properties of water with three ionic liquids: 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([bmim][PF6]), 1-n-octyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C(8)mim][PF6]), and 1-n-octyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([C(8)mim][BF4]). Although water stable, these compounds are hygroscopic, so the uptake of water vapor is an important issue. Due to the negligible volatility of ionic liquids, we were able to measure vapor-liquid equilibrium using a gravimetric microbalance, which was designed to measure adsorption on solids. The Henry's law constants range from 0.033 to 0.45 bar, with infinite dilution activity coefficients ranging from slight positive deviations from Raoult's law to as high as 8.62. The enthalpies and entropies of absorption are similar to those for the absorption of water into alcohols. In addition, we present water/ionic liquid liquid-liquid equilibria, which is important if water is used as a solvent to extract solutes from ionic liquids. In particular, dissolution of the ionic liquid in the aqueous phase could represent a wastewater treatment challenge. As one possible means for removing ionic liquids from water, we show that activated carbon is effective for this separation.},

The minimum energies for gas-phase alkali metal ion monohydrates are also examined for this (liquid phase) potential and found to be in reasonable agreement with experiments. It is argued that calculations of differential ion solvation energies are not enough to assess the validity of a given potential and that the most reliable way to obtain parameters for use in simulations of solutions and biomolecules is to calibrate the calculated absolute hydration free energies against observed ones.},

abstract = {A parallel message-passing implementation of a molecular dynamics (MD) program that is useful for bio(macro) molecules in aqueous environment is described. The software has been developed for a custom-designed 32-processor ring GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) with communication to and from left and right neighbours, but can run on any parallel system onto which a a ring of processors can be mapped and which supports PVM-like block send and receive calls. The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs @chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen Molecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling, The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles, Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step.},

abstract = {In this work we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the diffusion of N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and H2O as a function of temperature within the well-known metal- organic framework Co-2(dobdc)center dot[G] (G = 2DMF center dot 1H(2)O), also known as Co-MOF-74. The molecular dynamics simulations show that the diffusivity of guest molecules, which is almost negligible at low temperatures (T {\textless} 200 K), increases in the range of 200 {\textless} T (K) {\textless} 400 up to 3 and 4 orders of magnitude for DMF and H2O, respectively. This molecular diffusion can be easily detected by dielectric spectroscopy as it gives rise to extrinsic interfacial polarization effects that result in an apparent ''colossal'' dielectric constant at room temperature, epsilon(r)' similar to 42 000 (T = 300 K, nu = 10 Hz). Furthermore, the measured dielectric constant exhibits a thermal dependence similar to that of the diffusion coefficient, revealing the parallelism of the dielectric response and the molecular diffusion as a function of temperature. These results highlight: (a) the great utility of the fast and non-destructive dielectric and impedance spectroscopy techniques for the study and detection of the molecular transport of small polar molecules within porous metal-organic frameworks and related materials; (b) the peculiarity and uniqueness of MOF materials with ''medium'' size nanopores containing guest molecules as they are solid materials in which the guest molecules display a liquid state-like behaviour close to room temperature; and (c) the potential of these materials for molecular transport applications.},

abstract = {Understanding the properties of the solid electrolyte interphase (SET) of lithium batteries is important for minimizing interfacial resistance and improving battery safety and cycling. Ion transport has been investigated in the dilithium ethylene dicarbonate (Li2EDC) component of the SEI by impedance spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations employing a revised many-body polarizable APPLE{\&}P force field. The developed force field accurately described the binding energies in LiCH3CO3, its dimer, and Li2EDC calculated at the G4MP2 and MP2 levels. M05-2X and LC-omega PBE functionals predicted too high binding energy in lithium alkyl carbonates compared to the G4MP2 results, while the MP2 and M06-L predictions agreed well with the G4MP2 data. The conductivity of Li2EDC at room temperature was found to be 10(-9) S/cm from impedance measurements and extrapolation of MD simulation results. A near Arrhenius temperature dependence of Li2EDC's conductivity was found in the MD simulations with an activation energy ranging from 64 to 84 kJ/mol. At room temperature, the lithium transport was subdiffusive on time scales shorter than similar to 10(-2) s in MD simulations corresponding to the onset of the plateau of resistivity vs frequency occurring at frequencies lower than 10(2) Hz. The influence of Li2EDC ordering on the ion transport was investigated by contrasting supercooled amorphous melts and ordered material. At 393 K Li+ transport was heterogeneous, showing chainlike and looplike Li+ correlated displacements. The non-Gaussianity of Li+ transport was examined. The influence of polarization on the structure of the lithium coordination shell and ion transport has been investigated in the molten phase of Li2EDC and contrasted with the previous results obtained for room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs). Nonpolarizable Li2EDC exhibited orders of magnitude slower dynamics below 600 K and a higher activation energy for the Li+ diffusion coefficient. Initial simulations of Li2EDC dissolved in an EC:DMC(3:7)/LiPF6 liquid electrolyte were performed at 450 K and showed a strong aggregation of Li2EDC consistent with its phase separation from the electrolyte. The plasticizing effects of carbonate electrolyte on Li2EDC dynamics were examined.},

abstract = {The chemical composition of small organic molecules is often very similar to amino acid side chains or the bases in nucleic acids, and hence there is no a priori reason why a molecular mechanics force field could not describe both organic liquids and biomolecules with a single parameter set. Here, we devise a benchmark for force fields in order to test the ability of existing force fields to reproduce some key properties of organic liquids, namely, the density, enthalpy of vaporization, the surface tension, the heat capacity at constant volume and pressure, the isothermal compressibility, the volumetric expansion coefficient, and the static dielectric constant. Well over 1200 experimental measurements were used for comparison to the simulations of 146 organic liquids. Novel polynomial interpolations of the dielectric constant (32 molecules), heat capacity at constant pressure (three molecules), and the isothermal compressibility (53 molecules) as a function of the temperature have been made, based on experimental data, in order to be able to compare simulation results to them. To compute the heat capacities, we applied the two phase thermodynamics method (Lin et al. J. Chem. Phys. 2003, 119, 11792), which allows one to compute thermodynamic properties on the basis of the density of states as derived from the velocity autocorrelation function. The method is implemented in a new utility within the GROMACS molecular simulation package, named g{\_}dos, and a detailed expose of the underlying equations is presented. The purpose of this work is to establish the state of the art of two popular force fields, OPLS/AA (all-atom optimized potential for liquid simulation) and GAFF (generalized Amber force field), to find common bottlenecks, i.e., particularly difficult molecules, and to serve as a reference point for future force field development. To make for a fair playing field, all molecules were evaluated with the same parameter settings, such as thermostats and barostats, treatment of electrostatic interactions, and system size (1000 molecules). The densities and enthalpy of vaporization from an independent data set based on simulations using the CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF) presented by Vanommeslaeghe et al. (J. Comput. Chem. 2010, 31, 671) are included for comparison. We find that, overall, the OPLS/AA force field performs somewhat better than GAFF, but there are significant issues with reproduction of the surface tension and dielectric constants for both force fields.},

In this study, the solution of Li [bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide] (LiTFSI) in N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium TFSI (PYR14TFSI) ionic liquid in the 0.1:0.9 molar ratio is studied by heteronuclear NOE and NMR diffusion measurements. The main purpose is to spot on the interions organization and mobility. NOE data support the existence of strongly coordinated Li+ species, whereas variable temperature measurements of the self-diffusion coefficients D show large, selective, and unexpected enhancement of Li+ mobility with T. The measured activation energy for Li+ diffusion is significantly larger than those of TFSIâ{\`{a}}{\'{i}} and PYR14+. These findings can be related to the mechanism of Li+ diffusion in ILs based on disruption formation of the coordination shells of Li+ with TFSI anions rather than on the Brownian motion of the whole Li+ coordinated species.},

abstract = {The interactions between Ammoeng 100 and water are probed using high-pressure infrared measurements and DFT-calculations. The results of infrared absorption profiles suggest that the energetically favored approach for water molecules to interact with Ammoeng 100 is via the formation of anion-water interactions, whereas the alkyl C-H groups play much less important roles. After comparison with pure Ammoeng 100, it appears that no appreciable changes in band frequencies of alkyl C-H vibrations occurred as Ammoeng 100 was mixed with D2O. The presence of D2O has a red-shift effect on the peak frequency of the S-O stretching vibration under the pressures below 1 GPa in comparison to the absorption frequencies of pure Ammoeng 100. This observation is likely related to local structures of the S=O groups interacting with D2O molecules. DFT-calculations indicate that the most energetically favored conformation of ion pairs should be the species having only one hydrophilic hydrogen bonding. The results of calculations reveal that water addition may induce the partial replacement of C-H center dot center dot center dot O interactions with strong hydrogen bonding between anions and water molecules.},

The interfacial OMI+ cations are ordered with their imidazolium moiety pointing toward the aqueous side and their octyl chains toward the IL side of the interface. With the [BMI][PF6] liquid, the system gradually evolves from an IL-rich to a water-rich medium, leading to an ill-defined interfacial domain with high intersolvent mixing. As a result, the BMI+ cations are isotropically oriented "at the interface".

abstract = {The short time dynamics of tagged pairs of molecules that, at the initial time, are in the first coordination shell, is investigated in supercooled liquid water at 245 K by using the molecular dynamics technique with the four-points transferable intermolecular potential of Jorgensen [J. Chem. Phys. 79, 926 (1983)]. The instantaneous normal mode approach and the results of the local structure investigations are exploited to build up a correlation function of the relative displacements that represents the projection of normal modes along the initial center of mass separation vector. By imposing simple constraints to the initial dynamical conditions, localized damped oscillations of the centers of mass are detected along the hydrogen bond directions. The corresponding density of states shows a maximum around the frequency of 230 cm(-1) and its shape agrees with the frequency contributions expected from the translational phonon branches of ice. Total and radial correlation functions of the relative velocity are also computed. The radial component is dominated by oscillations at the frequency of 230 cm(-1); it compares fairly well with that derived from the translational density of states, thus supporting the reliability of the employed method. A slower component of motion, absent along the hydrogen bond direction, is derived; in the density of states, it produces a contribution peaked around 50 cm(-1).

The effects of Na ion concentration (0-60 mol{\%} Na[FSA]) and operation temperature (253-363 K) on the viscosity and ionic conductivity and charge-discharge performance of Na/Na[FSA]-[C3C1pyrr][FSA]/NaCrO2 cells are studied.

The operation temperature also significantly influences the charge-discharge performance, especially at low temperatures.

abstract = {Most of the force fields for ionic liquids cannot properly describe statics and dynamics. In this context, we propose an efficient method to adapt force fields, the basis of any classical molecular dynamics simulation. In the parameterisation process, a target function is minimized by a conjugate gradient based approach that vastly accelerates the tuning of the force field parameters through parallelization. As the description of the dynamics is captured in the parameterisation of the partial charges, we fit the short range parameters using only static properties, thus avoiding long simulations for the force field refinement. In the validation of the final parameterisation, the force field gives a good description of the dynamics in terms of the conductivity, especially in the temperature regime where the reference properties are matched very accurately. This method is sufficiently general and easily altered to fit an arbitrary set of reference properties, such that it can be considered for the construction of a versatile, transferable force field for ionic liquids.},

Use of B-splines in place of Lagrange interpolation leads to analytic gradients as well as a significant improvement in the accuracy. We demonstrate that arbitrary accuracy can be achieved, independent of system size N, at a cost that scales as N log(N).

abstract = {The self-aggregation behavior of the double-chained ionic liquid (IL) 1,3-didecyl-2-methylimidazolium chloride ([C10C10mim]Cl) in aqueous solution has been investigated with a number of different experimental techniques. Two cmc values (cmc1 and cmc2) are obtained from conductivity measurements. The fraction of neutralized charge on the micellar surface suggests that cmc1 corresponds to the formation of spherical micelles and cmc2 to the transition from spherical to cylindrical micelles. Data obtained from fluorescence spectroscopy (using pyrene and Nile red as chemical probes), fluorescence anisotropy (using rhodamine B as probe), and chemical shift (1)H NMR (in D2O) provide a picture that is also consistent with a sphere-to-cylinder transition. This structural change is further confirmed by diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY), from the self-diffusion coefficients for surfactant unimer and aggregates. Furthermore, a third evolution from cylindrical micelles to bilayer aggregates is proposed from the analysis of diffusion coefficients at high surfactant concentration ([IL] {\textgreater} 0.2 M). Phase scanning experiments performed with polarized light microscopy clearly demonstrate the presence of a lamellar liquid crystalline phase at very high IL concentration, thus confirming the coexistence of bilayer structures with elongated micelles, found at lower concentration. Additionally, [C10C10mim]Cl micelles are proposed as novel reaction media, as evidenced by the solvolysis reaction of 4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl chloride (MBSC).},

To investigate the solvent properties and potential use as a thermal fluid, a study was initiated to determine the effects of anion type, C- 2 hydrogen substitution, and alkyl chain length on the flammability, thermal stability, and phase change characteristics of 1,2,3- trialkylimidazolium room temperature ionic liquids. A Setaflash flashpoint apparatus was used to determine the flammabilities of the RTILs. No flashpoints were detected for any of the imidazolium based RTILs below 200 degrees C, the maximum temperature of the instrument. The thermal stabilities of the RTILs were measured using the technique of thermogravimetric analysis. The 1,2,3- trialkylimidazolium compounds exhibit slightly higher thermal stabilities than the comparable 1,3- dialkylimidazolium compounds; RTILs with nucleophilic anions decompose about 150 degrees C lower than RTILs with bulky fluoride containing anions; the alkyl chain length does not have a large effect on the thermal stability of the RTILs; and the pyrolysis decomposition exhibits higher thermal stabilities via a different mechanism than the oxidative decomposition. In addition, it was found that although the calculated onset temperatures were above 350 degrees C, significant decomposition does occur 100 degrees C or more below these temperatures. The phase change behaviors of several imidazolium based RTILs were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry. The melting points of the RTILs increased with increasing alkyl chain length. Most of the salts studied exhibited significant undercooling, which decreased as the length of the alkyl chain was increased. The hexafluorophosphate and bromide RTILs exhibited polymorphic and liquid crystalline behaviors as the alkyl chain length was increased above C10. The clearing point temperatures increased more rapidly with alkyl chain length than the melting point temperatures.},

abstract = {Ionic liquids (ILs) have recently garnered increased attention because of their potential environmental benefits as "green" replacements over conventional volatile organic solvents. While ILs cannot significantly volatilize and contribute to air pollution, even the most hydrophobic ones present some miscibility with water posing environmental risks to the aquatic ecosystems. Thus, the knowledge of ILs toxicity and their water solubility must be assessed before an accurate judgment of their environmental benefits and prior to their industrial applications. In this work, the mutual solubilities for [C(2)-C(8)mim][Tf(2)N] (n-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) and water between 288.15 and 318.15 K at atmospheric pressure were measured. Although these are among the most hydrophobic ionic liquids known, the solubility of water in these compounds is surprisingly large, ranging from 0.17 to 0.36 in mole fraction, while the solubility of these ILs in water is much lower ranging from 3.2 x 10(-5) to 1.1 X 10(-3) in mole fraction, in the temperature and pressure conditions studied. From the experimental data, the molar thermodynamic functions of solution and solvation such as Gibbs energy, enthalpy, and entropy at infinite dilution were estimated, showing that the solubility of these ILs in water is entropically driven. The predictive capability of COSMO-RS, a model based on unimolecular quantum chemistry calculations, was evaluated for the description of the binary systems investigated providing an acceptable agreement between the model predictions and the experimental data both with the temperature dependence and with the ILs structural variations.},

The aim of this work is to obtain further evidence about the molecular mechanism behind this phenomenon by evaluating the effect of a large series of inorganic and organic salts on the mutual solubilities of water and the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, [C(4)mim][Tf(2)N]. The magnitudes of the salting-in and salting-out effects were assessed by changing either the cation or the anion, in a series of salts, as well as the salt concentration. It was observed that the influence of the ions on the solubility followed the Hofmeister series. Both salting-in and salting-out effects were observed and they showed to be dependent on both the nature of the salt and its concentration, while the pH had only a marginal effect on the studied solubilities. On the basis of the solubility changes of the ionic liquid in water in the presence of salts and on NMR spectroscopic data, it will be shown that salting-out inducing ions (high charge density) and salting-in inducing ions (low charge density) act through different mechanisms. While the former act mainly through an entropic effect resulting from the formation of water-ion hydration complexes which cause the dehydration of the solute and the increase of the surface tension of the cavity, the salting-in results from a direct ion binding of the low charge density ions to the hydrophobic moieties of the solute.},

abstract = {The ionic nature of ionic liquids (ILs) results in a unique combination of intrinsic properties that produces increasing interest in the research of these fluids as environmentally friendly "neoteric" solvents. One of the main research fields is their exploitation as solvents for liquid-liquid extractions, but although ILs cannot vaporize leading to air pollution, they present non-negligible miscibility with water that may be the cause of some environmental aquatic risks. It is thus important to know the mutual solubilities between ILs and water before their industrial applications. In this work, the mutual solubilities of hydrophobic yet hygroscopic imidazolium-, pyridinium-, pyrrolidinium-, and piperidinium-based ILs in combination with the anions bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, hexafluorophosphate, and tricyanomethane with water were measured between 288.15 and 318.15 K. The effect of the ILs structural combinations, as well as the influence of several factors, namely cation side alkyl chain length, the number of cation substitutions, the cation family, and the anion identity in these mutual solubilities are analyzed and discussed. The hydrophobicity of the anions increases in the order [C(CN)(3)] {\textless} [PF(6)] {\textless} [Tf(2)N] while the hydrophobicity of the cations increases from [C(n)mim] {\textless} [C(n)mpy] {\textless}= [C(n)mpyr] {\textless} [C(n)mpip] and with the alkyl chain length increase. From experimental measurements of the temperature dependence of ionic liquid solubilities in water, the thermodynamic molar functions of solution, such as Gibbs energy, enthalpy, and entropy at infinite dilution were determined, showing that the solubility of these ILs in water is entropically driven and that the anion solvation at the IL-rich phase controls their solubilities in water. The COSMO-RS, a predictive method based on unimolecular quantum chemistry calculations, was also evaluated for the description of the water-IL binary systems studied, where it showed to be capable of providing an acceptable qualitative agreement with the experimental data.},

abstract = {Raman spectra of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide [C2mIm+][FSA?] ionic liquid solutions dissolving LiFSA salt of various concentrations were measured at 298 K. FSA? ((FSO2)2N?) is an analogue anion of bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide ((CF3SO2)2N?; TFSA?). We found that a solvation number of the Li+ ion in [C2mIm+][FSA?] is 3, though it has been well established that Li+ ion is solvated by two TFSA? anions in the corresponding ionic liquids below the Li+ ion mole fraction of xLi+ {\textless} 0.2. To yield further insight into larger solvation numbers, Raman spectra were measured at higher temperatures up to 364 K. The Li+ ion solvation number in [C2mIm+][FSA?] evidently decreased when the temperature was elevated. Temperature dependence of the Li+ ion solvation number was analyzed assuming an equilibrium between [Li(FSA)2]? and [Li(FSA)3]2?, and the enthalpy ?HÂ° and the temperature multiplied entropy T?SÂ° for one FSA? liberation toward a bulk ionic liquid were successfully evaluated to be 35(2) kJ mol?1 and 29(2) kJ mol?1, respectively. The ?HÂ° and ?SÂ° suggest that the Li+ ion is coordinated by one of bidentate and two of monodentate FSA? at 298 K, and that the more weakly solvated monodentate FSA? is liberated at higher temperatures. The high-energy X-ray diffraction (HEXRD) experiments of these systems were carried out and were analyzed with the aid of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In radial distribution functions evaluated with HEXRD, a peak at about 1.94 {\AA} appeared and was attributable to the Li+?O(FSA?) correlations. The longer Li+?O(FSA?) distance than that for the Li+?O(TFSA?) of 1.86 {\AA} strongly supports the larger solvation number of the Li+ ions in the FSA? based ionic liquids. MD simulations at least qualitatively reproduced the Raman and HEXRD experiments.},

abstract = {The structure of Water in sodium halide aqueous solutions at different concentrations is studied through molecular dynamics. Emphasis is placed on the extent of ionic-induced changes in the Water structure, and the concept of kosmotropes/chaotropes is probed, in terms of perturbations to the tetrahedral H-bond network of water. The results show that at low salt concentrations, the halide anions slightly increase the tetrahedrality of the H-bond network of water in the anionic second hydration shell and I- is found to be the strongest kosmotrope, contrary to its structure breaker reputation. The sodium cation in turn induces a significant loss of tetrahedrality in the second cationic hydration shell. At higher concentrations, the dominant disruptive effect of Na+ cancels the anionic effects, even in the anionic second hydration shell. According to a kosmotropes/chaotropes classification of ions, based on the tetrahedrality of the H-bond network of water, halide anions are therefore weak kosmotropes, while Na+ is a strong chaotrope. However, if this classification is applied to the salts, rather than to the ions, all of the sodium halides are classified as structure breakers even at low concentrations. Further, the effect of pressure on the tetrahedrality of the H-bond network of water is found to be similar to the average effect of the dissolved salts. The present results indicate that the classification of ions in kosmotropes/chaotropes in terms of long-range perturbations to the tetrahedral H-bond network of water is not correlated to the position of the ions in the respective Hofmeister series.},

Using a vacuum line, measurements of the viscosity were made under a water-vapor free atmosphere. The viscosity decreases sharply with temperature and increases as the alkyl chain length increases. The molecular dynamics simulation was performed for the densities of these ionic liquids to remedy the lack of literature experimental data. The results are quite in agreement with the experiments, with a maximum deviation of 3.00 {\%} due to [C(8)mim]I at 358 K. The viscosities fit best in the modified Arrhenius, Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT), and Litovitz equations. The viscosities also fit in the simple linear equation we proposed recently with accuracies comparable with Litovitz and VFT.},

abstract = {Bulk and surface properties of the ionic liquids 1-alkyl-3-methyl-imidazolium iodides ([C(n)mim]I) were simulated by classical molecular dynamics using all atom non-polarizable force field (n = 4, butyl; 6, hexyl; 8, octyl). The structure of ionic liquids were initially optimized by density functional theory and atomic charges obtained by CHELPG method. Reduction of partial atomic charges (by 20{\%} for simulation of density and surface tension, and by 10{\%} for viscosity) found to improve the accuracy, while a non-polarizable force field was applied. Additionally, the simulation ensembles approach the equilibrium faster when the charge reduction is applied. By these refined force field parameters, simulated surface tensions in the range of 323-393 k are quite in agreement with the experiments. Simulation of temperature dependent surface tension of [C(4)mim]I well beyond room temperature (up to 700 K) permits prediction of the critical temperature in agreement with that predicted from experimental surface tension data. Simulated densities in the range of 298-450 K for the three ionic liquids are within 0.8{\%} of the experimental data. Structural properties for [C(4)mim]I were found to be in agreement with the results of Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulation we performed, which indicates a rather well-structured cation-anion interaction and occurs essentially through the imidazolium ring cation. Diffusion coefficient changes with alkyl chain length in the order of [C(8)mim]I {\textgreater} [C(6)mim]I {\textgreater} [C(4)mim]I for the cation and the anion. Formation of a dense domain in subsurface region is quite evident, and progressively becomes denser as the alkyl chain length increases. Bivariate orientational analysis was used to determine the average orientation of molecule in ionic liquids surface, subsurface, and bulk regions. Dynamic bisector-wise and side-wise movement of the imodazolium ring cation in the surface region can be deduced from the bivariate maps. Atom-atom density profile and bivariate analysis indicate that the imidazolium cation takes a spoon like configuration in the surface region and the tilt of alkyl group is a function length of alkyl chain exposing as linear as possible to the vapor phase.

abstract = {Constant temperature molecular dynamics has been used to simulate the adsorption of hydrated halide ions X- = F-, Cl-, Br- and I-, and lithium ion Li+ on flat uniformly charged surfaces. The simulations were done with either 214 water molecules and two ions (Li+ and X-) in a box 2.362 nm deep or with 430 water molecules and the two ions in a box 4.320 nm deep. The boxes were periodically replicated in the xy directions. The magnitude of the surface charge on the box ends was +/- 0.11 e/(nm)2, corresponding to an electric field of 2 X 10(7) V/cm. The lateral dimensions of the simulation cell were 1.862 nm X 1.862 nm (x X y) in each case. All of the water molecules and ions interacted with the end walls via a weak 9-3 potential. The Stillinger ST2 water model and parameters optimized for alkali halides interacting with the model ST2 water molecule were used in the calculations. Common particles of truncating the interactions at a finite distance (0.82 nm) and switching off Coulomb interactions at small distances were followed. The temperature was set at T = 2.41 1 kJ/mol (290 K). Some of the properties calculated were distribution density profiles for ions and water across the gap important for comparisons with Gouy-Chapman theory, adsorbed ion-water pair correlation functions, and the number of water molecules in the first and second hydration shells of the ions as a function of time. The time spent by a water molecule in the hydration shell was calculated to be approximately ten times longer for lithium than any other ion. The correlation between distance from the electrode and hydration number was studied and generally found to be pronounced for the larger anions. Comparison of the dynamics of the common ion Li+ for different anions revealed the subtle influence of a transcell interaction in the 2.362 nm thick film. In the given field, the smallest ions Li+ and F- remained fully solvated at all times. Chloride behaved quite differently. Part of the time this ion was far enough away from the electrode to be fully hydrated and part of the time it was in physical contact (i.e., physisorbed) on the electrode with no water molecules interposed between it and the electrode. Bromide favored contact adsorption over full hydration most of the time. Iodide was observed to be contact adsorbed almost all of the time. These simulations provide new insights on the behavior of strongly hydrated ions at surfaces and how the transition from noncontact to ''contact'' adsorption occurs.},

abstract = {A seeming contradiction has been revealed between the behaviour of the shortest intermolecular separation r(00) and that of the frequency of the OH vibration of H(2)O under compression in liquid water. Decrease of r(00) with increasing pressure up to 2 kbar seems to be evidence of strengthening of the hydrogen bonding, but the increase in the frequency of v(OH) H(2)O seems contradictory. To clear up this question, measurements of the integrated intensity of IR absorption for v(OD) HDO have been made which definitely show that the energy of the hydrogen bonds decreases under compression at least up to 1.5 kbar. The decrease in the intensity is of about 20{\%}, i.e., essentially more than the estimated accuracy of the measurements. Monte Carlo simulations of the compression of liquid water show that the behaviour of r(00), v(OH), and the integrated intensity can be explained by the bending of hydrogen bonds.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to study the complex and heterogeneous dynamics of ions in ionic liquids. The dynamics of cations and anions in 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium nitrate (EMIM-NO(3)) are characterized by van Hove functions and the corresponding intermediate scattering functions F(s)(k,t) and elucidated by the trajectories augmented by the use of singular spectrum analysis (SSA). Several time regions are found in the mean squared displacement of the ions. Change in the slope in a plot of the diffusion coefficient against temperature is found at around 410 K in the simulation. Heterogeneous dynamics with the presence of both localized ions and fast ions capable of successive jumps were observed at long time scales in the self-part of the van Hove functions and in the trajectories. Non-Gaussian dynamics are evidenced by the self-part of the van Hove functions and wave number dependence of F(s)(k,t) and characterized as Levy flights. Successive motion of some ions can continue even after several nanoseconds at 370 K, which is longer than the onset time of diffusive motion, t(dif). Structure of the long time dynamics of fast ions is clarified by the phase space plot of the successive motion using the denoised data by SSA. The continual dynamics are shown to have a long term memory, and therefore local structure is not enough to explain the heterogeneity. The motion connecting localized regions at about 370 K is jumplike, but there is no typical one due to local structural changes during jump motion. With the local motion, mutual diffusion between cation and anion occurs. On decreasing temperature, mutual diffusion is suppressed, which results in slowing down of the dynamics. This "mixing effect of cation and anion" is compared with the "mixed alkali effect" found in the ionics in the ionically conducting glasses, where the interception of paths by different alkali metal ions causes the large reduction in the dynamics [J. Habasaki and K. L. Ngai, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 9, 4673 (2007), and references herein]. Although a similar mechanism of the slowing down is observed, strong coupling of the motion of cation and anion prevents complete interception unless deeply supercooled, and this explains the wide temperature region of the existence of the liquid and supercooled liquid states in the ionic liquid.},

abstract = {The nature of glycine--glycine interactions in aqueous solution has been studied using molecular dynamics simulations at four different concentrations and, in each case, four different temperatures. Although evidence is found for formation of small, transient hydrogen-bonded clusters of glycine molecules, the main type of interaction between glycine molecules is found to be single NH...OC hydrogen bonds. Double-hydrogen-bonded "dimers", which have often been cited as a significant species present in aqueous solutions of glycine, are only observed infrequently. When double-hydrogen-bonded dimers are formed, they dissociate quickly (typically within less than ca. 4 ps), although the broken hydrogen bonds have a higher than average probability of reforming. Several aspects of the clustering of glycine molecules are investigated as a function of both temperature and concentration, including the size distribution of glycine clusters, the radii of gyration of the clusters, and aspects of the lifetimes of glycine-glycine hydrogen bonding by means of hydrogen-bond correlation functions. Diffusion coefficients for the glycine clusters and water molecules are also investigated and provide results in realistic agreement with experimental results.},

abstract = {Abstract The focus in this chapter is on the development of approximate theories for the pair distribution function of atomic fluids, but it is first shown how this function can be measured by radiation scattering experiments. Exact and approximate relations between the pair and triplet distribution functions can be derived from the static version of the BBGKY hierarchy. Functional Taylor expansion of the free energy functional leads to a variety of integral equations for the pair distribution function, corresponding to different approximate closures of the OrnsteinâZernike relation, including the hypernetted chain (HNC), PercusâYevick (PY) and mean spherical (MSA) approximations, while diagrammatic expansions lead to further useful results. The PercusâYevick equation has an analytical solution in the case of hard spheres. Improved integral equation approximations that lead to self-consistent results for thermodynamic properties are briefly discussed. The asymptotic (large separation) behaviour of the pair function can be deduced by extension of the OrnsteinâZernike relation to complex wavenumbers.},

abstract = {Abstract This chapter is devoted to thermodynamic perturbation theory, through which the pair structure and thermodynamics of a given liquid are related to the corresponding properties of a simpler, reference fluid, often taken to be a hard-sphere fluid. Perturbation theory accounts both for the softness of the short-range repulsion between atoms and for the range of the attractive interaction, exemplified by results obtained for the Lennard-Jones fluid. Application to the mean field or generalised van der Waals theory of liquid-vapour coexistence is also discussed. Deviations from mean field behaviour near the critical point are characterised by scaling laws with non-classical critical exponents. A combination of perturbation theory with renormalisation group techniques developed for discrete models such as the lattice gas leads to hierarchical reference theory, which provides an accurate description of the critical behaviour of fluid systems.},

The thermodynamics of surface effects is reviewed and microscopic expressions for the surface tension are derived. Approximate free energy functionals are introduced within the framework of density functional theory to cope with a variety of physical situations. Particular attention is given to fundamental measure theory, designed for inhomogeneous hard-sphere fluids. Other problems treated are the calculation of the density profiles of confined fluids, the behaviour of fluids in random pores, the theory of freezing, and wetting and drying phenomena displayed by fluids near a solid substrate. A brief introduction is provided to the thermodynamic properties of supercooled liquids and the glass transition.},

Time correlation functions and their frequency spectra are defined, and their general properties established. The velocity autocorrelation function is taken as an example and its relevance to atomic diffusion, as represented by Einstein's relation, is described. The brownian motion of a large, tagged particle in a bath of microscopic particles is discussed within the framework of the stochastic model due to Langevin; a non-Markovian generalisation of the Langevin equation leads to the concept of a memory function. A number of position and time-dependent correlation functions are introduced. These include the van Hove function, which describes the inelastic scattering of thermal neutrons. The dynamical response of a system to a time-dependent external field is related to equilibrium time correlation functions within linear response theory and to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.},

abstract = {Abstract In this chapter a link is established between the low-frequency, long-wavelength limit of the spectra of time correlation functions and the linearised equations of hydrodynamics, in which the transport coefficients of viscosity and thermal conductivity appear. This relationship between microscopic dynamics and macroscopic flow allows the derivation of microscopic, GreenâKubo expressions for the transport coefficients. A generalised hydrodynamics formalism, based on memory functions, allows the calculation of collective mode spectra on atomic scales of time and length. Hydrodynamic feed-back effects are found to lead to the development of long-time tails in time correlation functions. The dynamics of supercooled liquids near the kinetic glass transition are shown to be characterised both by dynamical slowing down and by non-equilibrium phenomena such as ageing and breakdown of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The flow of liquids near a solid substrate is described by a slipping length and a liquidâsolid friction coefficient, which can be calculated by linear response theory.},

Integral equation approximations give reasonable results for the pair structure and thermodynamics of ionic liquids.

Here the methods already developed are extended to molecular liquids, where allowance nust be made for the presence of orientational degrees of freedom. This generalisation leads to complications that are largely technical in nature. In particular, molecular pair distribution function now depends on the mutual orientation of two molecules. An alternative representation of the liquid structure is one based on radial, site-site distribution functions. The case of dipolar liquids is discussed first and the relationship between pair correlation functions and the dielectric constant is established. Diagrammatic expansions are adapted to deal with site-site interaction models and the resulting reference interaction-site model (RISM) theory is analysed; related theories are applied to associating liquids. Approximations for certain reorientational time correlation functions are derived.},

The theoretical approach employed is that of statistical coarse graining, whereby degrees of freedom of microscopic particles are integrated out to yield an effective, state-dependent interaction between particles of mesoscopic size. This strategy is applied to polymer solutions and melts, colloidal dispersions, charge-stabilised colloids, colloidal liquid crystals, clustering and gelation. Dynamic coarse graining leads to the FokkerâPlanck and Smoluchowski equations for the motion of brownian particles and to dynamical density functional theory (DDFT); spinodal decomposition is discussed as an application of DDFT.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) have been widely recognized as alternative green, tunable and robust electrolytes for mesoscopic dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) due to their unique properties. The negligible volatility of RTILs renders them more suitable than molecular solvents for longterm device use, while the high thermal and electrochemical stability fulfill the essential requirements for electrolyte applications. In spite of the relatively high viscosities of common RTIL iodides, the mass transport limitations can be effectively alleviated by the contribution of a Grotthous-type charge exchange mechanism. More interestingly, the physicochemical properties of RTILs can be facilely tuned by tailoring their cationic and anionic structures, which provides great feasibility for the specific designing of application-oriented RTILs. In this Feature Article, recent progress on highly efficient DSCs with RTIL electrolytes are summarized, with a special focus on the structural-dependence of the ionic diffusion property in RTIL electrolytes, as well as the charge transport and recombination kinetics at RTIL electrolytes/dye molecule/TiO2 electrodes interfaces. Furthermore, recent advances in RTIL electrolytes with iodine-free redox couples have been reviewed. Crucial issues that should be addressed in the pursuit of future developing low-cost and high-efficient RTIL electrolytes are also discussed.},

Structurally, Li(+) is shown to be solvated by three anion neighbors in [pyr14][TFSI] and four anion neighbors in both [pyr13][FSI] and [EMIM][BF4], and at all levels of xLi(+) we find the presence of lithium aggregates. Pulsed field gradient spin-echo NMR measurements of diffusion and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements of ionic conductivity are made for the neat ionic liquids as well as 0.5 molal solutions of Li-salt in the ionic liquids. Bulk ionic liquid properties (density, diffusion, viscosity, and ionic conductivity) are obtained with MD simulations and show excellent agreement with experiment. While the diffusion exhibits a systematic decrease with increasing xLi(+), the contribution of Li(+) to ionic conductivity increases until reaching a saturation doping level of xLi(+) = 0.10. Comparatively, the Li(+) conductivity of [pyr14][TFSI] is an order of magnitude lower than that of the other liquids, which range between 0.1 and 0.3 mS/cm. Our transport results also demonstrate the necessity of long MD simulation runs (â¼200 ns) to converge transport properties at room temperature. The differences in Li(+) transport are reflected in the residence times of Li(+) with the anions ($\tau$(Li/-)), which are revealed to be much larger for [pyr14][TFSI] (up to 100 ns at the highest doping levels) than in either [EMIM][BF4] or [pyr13][FSI]. Finally, to comment on the relative kinetics of Li(+) transport in each liquid, we find that while the net motion of Li(+) with its solvation shell (vehicular) significantly contributes to net diffusion in all liquids, the importance of transport through anion exchange increases at high xLi(+) and in liquids with large anions.},

abstract = {Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was applied as a suitable technique to characterize the electrolyte/platinum interface of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC). The charge-transfer resistance of the electrolyte/platinum interface was examined for different solvents, cations, methods of platinizing the transparent conducting oxide and thicknesses of the platinum layer. One result is that 2 nm of Pt is sufficient for a DSC with acetonitrile as the solvent. Effects of poisoning the catalyst have been discovered. The diffusion constant of IT in the electrolyte was evaluated for different solvents by measuring the diffusion-limited current density. The diffusion overpotential was measured for different bias potentials. At high potentials, a triiodide production in the electrolyte was found. The mechanism of the charge-transfer reaction at the platinum/electrolyte interface was investigated by measuring the dependence of the charge-transfer resistance on the concentrations of iodide and triiodide ions in the electrolyte. The rate-determining step was found to be the electron transfer from I- to the Pt electrode. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Interactions between ionic liquid surfactant [C12mim]Br and DNA in dilute brine were investigated in terms of various experimental methods and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. It was shown that the aggregation of [C12mim]Br on DNA chains is motivated not only by electrostatic attractions between DNA phosphate groups and [C12mim]Br headgroups but also by hydrophobic interactions among [C12mim]Br alkyl chains. Isothermal titration calorimetry analysis indicated that the [C12mim]Br aggregation in the presence and absence of DNA are both thermodynamically favored driven by enthalpy and entropy. DNA undergoes size transition and conformational change induced by [C12mim]Br, and the charges of DNA are neutralized by the added [C12mim]Br. Various microstructures were observed such as DNA with loose coil conformation in nature state, necklace-like structures, and compact spherical aggregates. MD simulation showed that the polyelectrolyte collapses upon the addition of oppositely charged surfactants and the aggregation of surfactants around the polyelectrolyte was reaffirmed. The simulation predicted the gradual neutralization of the negatively charged polyelectrolyte by the surfactant, consistent with the experimental results. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Here, we present a new implementation of our molecular simulation toolkit GROMACS which now both achieves extremely high performance on single processors from algorithmic optimizations and hand-coded routines and simultaneously scales very well on parallel machines. The code encompasses a minimal-communication domain decomposition algorithm, full dynamic load balancing, a state-of-the-art parallel constraint solver, and efficient virtual site algorithms that allow removal of hydrogen atom degrees of freedom to enable integration time steps up to 5 fs for atomistic simulations also in parallel. To improve the scaling properties of the common particle mesh Ewald electrostatics algorithms, we have in addition used a Multiple-Program, Multiple-Data approach, with separate node domains responsible for direct and reciprocal space interactions. Not only does this combination of algorithms enable extremely long simulations of large systems but also it provides that simulation performance on quite modest numbers of standard cluster nodes.},

IL strategies can take advantage of the dual nature ( discrete ions) of ILs to realize enhancements which may include controlled solubility ( e. g., both hydrophilic and hydrophobic ILs are possible), bioavailability or bioactivity, stability, elimination of polymorphism, new delivery options ( e. g., slow release or the IL- API as 'solvent'), or even customized pharmaceutical cocktails. Here we exemplify this approach with, among others, lidocaine docusate ( LD), a hydrophobic room temperature IL which, when compared to lidocaine hydrochloride, exhibits modfied solubility, increased thermal stability, and a significant enhancement in the e. cacy of topical analgesia in two different models of mouse antinociception. Studies of the suppression of nerve growth factor mediated neuronal di. erentiation in rat pheochromocytoma ( PC12) cells suggests potential differences between LD and lidocaine hydrochloride at the cellular level indicating an entirely different mechanism of action. Taken together these results suggest that the unique physiochemical properties of ILs in general, may confer a novel effect for the bioactivity of an API due to (at least) slow-release properties in addition to novel delivery mechanisms.},

abstract = {Ionic liquids (IL) and hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) are two diverse fields for which there is a developing recognition of significant overlap. Doubly ionic H-bonds occur when a H-bond forms between a cation and anion, and are a key feature of ILs. Doubly ionic H-bonds represent a wide area of H-bonding which has yet to be fully recognised, characterised or explored. H-bonds in ILs (both protic and aprotic) are bifurcated and chelating, and unlike many molecular liquids a significant variety of distinct H-bonds are formed between different types and numbers of donor and acceptor sites within a given IL. Traditional more neutral H-bonds can also be formed in functionalised ILs, adding a further level of complexity. Ab initio computed parameters; association energies, partial charges, density descriptors as encompassed by the QTAIM methodology ([small rho]BCP), qualitative molecular orbital theory and NBO analysis provide established and robust mechanisms for understanding and interpreting traditional neutral and ionic H-bonds. In this review the applicability and extension of these parameters to describe and quantify the doubly ionic H-bond has been explored. Estimating the H-bonding energy is difficult because at a fundamental level the H-bond and ionic interaction are coupled. The NBO and QTAIM methodologies, unlike the total energy, are local descriptors and therefore can be used to directly compare neutral, ionic and doubly ionic H-bonds. The charged nature of the ions influences the ionic characteristics of the H-bond and vice versa, in addition the close association of the ions leads to enhanced orbital overlap and covalent contributions. The charge on the ions raises the energy of the Ylp and lowers the energy of the X-H [sigma]* NBOs resulting in greater charge transfer, strengthening the H-bond. Using this range of parameters and comparing doubly ionic H-bonds to more traditional neutral and ionic H-bonds it is clear that doubly ionic H-bonds cover the full range of weak through to very strong H-bonds.},

abstract = {Recombination in Dye-sensitized Solar Cells (DSCs) is an electron transfer process critical for high efficiency. The chemical nature of the electron acceptor is known to have an important impact on recombination and, hence, limits the choice of hole conductors in DSCs and related solar cells. In this respect, Room Temperature Ionic liquids (RTILs) have been recognized as an alternative to volatile organic solvents due to their negligible vapor pressure, which offers the chance for long-term stability. However, RTIL-based electrolytes lead to lower performance, a feature that has been attributed to the high viscosity of ionic liquids and the mass-transport limitation associated with it. In this work we show that the origin of the lower performance is also related to an increase in the recombination loss due to the polar nature of the RTIL and the influence of the reorganization energy of the electron acceptor in a polar environment. To investigate this chemical effect, different mixing ratios of RTILs and an organic solvent (acetonitrile) have been considered. The fabricated devices have been characterized by small-perturbation techniques (Impedance Electrochemical Spectroscopy and Intensity-Modulated Photovoltage and Photocurrent Spectroscopies) and Open-Circuit Voltage Decay measurements, which have been used to extract electron lifetimes at different applied voltages. Two different ruthenium dyes (hydrophilic N719 and hydrophobic Z907) and two different cations in the RTIL (imidazolium- and pyrrolidinium-based) have been considered. The results obtained show that for pure ionic liquids the lifetime-voltage curve is exponential, which is a signature of large reorganization energies for electron transfer. In contrast, pure acetonitrile exhibits a non-exponential behavior, which is consistent with relatively low reorganization energy. Interestingly, and as a general rule, we find that recombination is faster in systems with higher reorganization energies. This is interpreted as a consequence of the availability of more acceptor states for electron transfer. In addition, it is found that mixing RTILs and acetonitrile is an interesting strategy to increase the stability of DSCs without significant recombination losses, provided that the right dye and RTIL, in particular, a pyrrolidinium component, are used.},

abstract = {We have performed steady state UV-visible absorption and time-resolved fluorescence measurements and computer simulations to explore the cosolvent mole fraction induced changes in structural and dynamical properties of water/dioxane (Diox) and water/tetrahydrofuran (THF) binary mixtures. Diox is a quadrupolar solvent whereas THF is a dipolar one although both are cyclic molecules and represent cycloethers. The focus here is on whether these cycloethers can induce stiffening and transition of water H-bond network structure and, if they do, whether such structural modification differentiates the chemical nature (dipolar or quadrupolar) of the cosolvent molecules. Composition dependent measured fluorescence lifetimes and rotation times of a dissolved dipolar solute (Coumarin 153, C153) suggest cycloether mole-fraction (X-THF/Diox) induced structural transition for both of these aqueous binary mixtures in the 0.1 {\textless}= X-THF/Diox {\textless}= 0.2 regime with no specific dependence on the chemical nature. Interestingly, absorption measurements reveal stiffening of water H-bond structure in the presence of both the cycloethers at a nearly equal mole-fraction, X-THF/Diox similar to 0.05. Measurements near the critical solution temperature or concentration indicate no role for the solution criticality on the anomalous structural changes. Evidences for cycloether aggregation at very dilute concentrations have been found. Simulated radial distribution functions reflect abrupt changes in respective peak heights at those mixture compositions around which fluorescence measurements revealed structural transition. Simulated water coordination numbers (for a dissolved C153) and number of H-bonds also exhibit minima around these cosolvent concentrations. In addition, several dynamic heterogeneity parameters have been simulated for both the mixtures to explore the effects of structural transition and chemical nature of cosolvent on heterogeneous dynamics of these systems. Simulated four-point dynamic susceptibility suggests formation of clusters inducing local heterogeneity in the solution structure. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.},

Different physicochemical properties such as the critical micelle concentration (CMC), interfacial properties, aggregate size, and polydispersity were determined. Just like in aqueous medium, micelles formed and CMC values were found to be larger in ionic aqueous/liquids (IL) than in water. The results revealed that the surface activity is much lower in aqueous/IL than in water. The types of anion and alkyl substitutions on the imidazolium ring were shown to be affecting the aggregation behavior. The variation of chemical shifts in the presence of surfactant revealed that the hydrogen bonding is an important factor in defining the solvent properties of ionic liquids since the structure of their hydrogen bond network which depends on their molecular structure has a prominent influence on solubility and the CMC of surfactants. It is demonstrated that HMImBr can be incorporated in CTAB micelles and form mixed micelles, but N-BImCl behaves partly as a solvent toward alerting the physicochemical properties of CTAB.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out to investigate nanostructural organization in mixtures of 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium nitrate ionic liquid and water at multiple water concentrations. Evolution of the polar network, water network, and micelle structures is visualized and analyzed via partial radial distribution functions. The calculated static partial structure factors show that within the range of water contents examined, polar networks, water networks, and micelles possess an approximately invariant characteristic length at around 20 A. Furthermore, the above calculations point out that, as the amount of water increases, the polar network is continuously broken up (screened) by the intruding water, while the structural organization of the water network and the micelle exhibits a turnover. At the turnover point, the most ordered micelle (cation-cation) structure and water (water-anion-water) network are formed. Thereafter, the structural organization abates drastically, and only loose micelle structure exists due to the dominant water-water interactions. The simulated turnover of structural organization agrees with the sharpest peak in the experimentally obtained structure factor in aqueous solutions of similar ionic liquids; the simulated water structure reveals that water can form liquidlike associated aggregates due to the planar symmetry and strong basicity of NO(3)(-), in agreement with experiment. The turnover of structural organization of micelles results from the persistent competition between the hydrophobic interactions of the nonpolar groups and the breakup of the charged polar network with increasing water content, whereas the turnover of the water network results from the competition between the water-water and water-anion interactions.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been performed to investigate the structure and dynamics of an energetic ionic liquid, 1-hydroxyethyl-4-amino-1,2,4-triazolium nitrate (HEATN). The generalized amber force field (GAFF) was used, and an electronically polarizable model was further developed in the spirit of our previous work (Yan, T.; Burnham, C.J.; Del Popolo, M. G.; Voth, G. A. J. Phys. Chem. B 2004,108,11877). In. the process of simulated annealing from a liquid state at 475 K down to a glassy state at 175 K, the MD simulations identify a glass-transition temperature region at around 250-275 K, in agreement with experiment. The self-intermediate scattering functions show vanishing boson peaks in the supercooled region, indicating that HEATN may be a fragile glass former. The coupling/decoupling of translational and reorientational ion motion is also discussed, and various other physical properties of the liquid state are intensively studied at 400 K. A complex hydrogen bond network was revealed with the calculation of partial radial distribution functions. When compared to the similarly sized 1-ethyl-4-methyl-1,4-imidazolium nitrate ionic liquid, EMIM+/NO3, a hydrogen bond network directly resulting in the poorer packing efficiency of ions is observed, which is responsible for the lower melting/glass-transition point. The structural properties of the liquid/vacuum interface shows that there is vanishing layering at the interface, in accordance with the poor ion packing. The effects of electronic polarization on the self-diffusion, viscosity, and surface tension of HEATN are found to be significant, in agreement with an earlier study on EMIM+/NO3-.},

The cage system of the framework can be exploited to enhance adsorption of small gases. We find that nonpolar molecules adsorb preferentially in the small tetrahedral cages, whereas alcohols and water molecules adsorb close to the copper atoms in one of the big cages. Blocking potentially enhances selective adsorption and separation and we therefore investigate how to block these cages in a practical manner. We propose to use ionic liquids for it and we find that the addition of these components reduces the adsorption of polar molecules near the open metal centers. For this reason, the presence of ionic liquids reduces the attack of the molecules of water to the metallic centers improving the framework stability.},

abstract = {Ionic liquids (ILs) form a new class of compounds with a much varied industrial and technological application. Some research has been conducted in ecotoxicity of these compounds, but very little is known about their structure in aqueous solutions. It is known that some ionic liquids can form aggregates in aqueous solution. To determine how such structures influence the use, distribution and toxicity of ILs, first the critical micelle concentrations of the ILs need to be determined. Therefore the critical micelle concentration (CMC) for a number of imidazolium ionic liquids was determined in aqueous solution. The expected dependency of the CMC on the length of the alkyl chain of the investigated 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium ILs, was shown. The degree of ionization and the energy of aggregation were calculated and related to the alkyl chain length of the imidazolium. A significant correlation between retention times in reversed phase gradient HPLC, and the pCMC was observed. It was also shown that the CMC is directly related to the lipophilicity of the cation.

One of the most important properties of such two-phase systems is the mutual solubility of the IL and water. Recent advancements on this subject have been reviewed. The solubility of ionic liquids in water is related to the standard Gibbs energies of the transfer of ions constituting the ionic liquid from the ionic liquid phase to water. Although this single ionic property cannot be measured thermodynamically and also varies from one ionic liquid to another, the standard Gibbs energy of the ion transfer from a polar aprotic solvent, such as nitrobenzene and 1,2-dichloroethane, to water is a convenient measure for it. The solubility of an ionic liquid in water and the electrochemical properties at the interface between the two phases are intimately related with each other.},

abstract = {Monte Carlo computer simulations were performed under thermodynamic conditions corresponding to available X-ray and neutron diffraction measurements of the supercritical water structure. A detailed analysis of hydrogen bonding in supercritical water is presented, based on the recently proposed hybrid distance-energy criterion of H-bonding. Good agreement is found with all available experimental and computer simulated results. With increasing temperature, the average number of H-bonds per a water molecule, [n(HB)], decreases with the same slope for both high-density (similar to 1.0 g/cm(3)) as well as low-density (similar to 0.2 g/cm(3)) supercritical water, asymptotically approaching zero at higher temperatures and lower densities. Over the whole supercritical region, except fur the highest density slates, [n(HB)] is always below the percolation threshold (similar to 1.6), indicating that the continuous network of hydrogen bonds is broken. Nevertheless, even at the highest temperature and the lowest density simulated, some degree of hydrogen bonding is still present in the form of dimers and trimers. For supercritical conditions of 673 R and 0.66 g/cm(3), average hydrogen bonds are almost 10{\%} weaker, 5{\%} longer, and about 8 degrees more bent, compared to those in normal liquid water. However, over 40{\%} of them are still preserved in the supercritical state, in good aggreement with estimates from all available experimental data.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to find the primary factor determining the mixing of the counter anions of 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium-based ionic liquid (IL, C(n)mimX) at the air/water interface. First, the properties of the adsorbed films of the C(10)mimBr-C(10)mimBF(4) mixtures were estimated by using the thermodynamic analysis of their surface tension data. The mole fraction of BF4- was lower in the adsorbed films than in the ideal state and the excess Gibbs energy of adsorption was negative, which was in marked contrast to those of the C(6)mimBr-C(6)mimBF(4) mixtures. Meanwhile, the possibility of forming side-by-side ion pair of BF4- and imidazolium ring at the adsorbed films, as we found in the C(6)mimBr-C(6)mimBF(4) system, was greatly reduced in the present case. These changes were mainly attributed to the reduction in the hydrogen-bonding interaction between BF4- and C(10)mim(+), as the carbon number in the hydrophobic part of C(n)mim(+) was increased from 6 to 10. In addition, it was found that the values of excess Gibbs energy of adsorption were less negative in the C(10)mimBr-C(10)mimBF(4) system than in the dodecyltrimethylammonium (C(12)TA)Br-C(12)TABF(4) system, where the long-range Columbic interaction solely exists between the counter anions and surfactant cations. Thus, we concluded that the short-range hydrogen-bonding interaction played an essential role in the interfacial activity of ILs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The scattering peaks in the structure functions generally shift to lower Q values with increased temperature for all the liquids in this series. However, the first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP) in the longer alkyl chain liquids displays a marked shift to higher Q values with increasing temperature. Alkyl chain-dependent ordering of the polar groups and increased tail aggregation with increasing alkyl chain length were observed in the partial pair correlation functions and the structure functions. The reasons for the observed alkyl chain-dependent phenomena and temperature effects were explored.},

The force field is built in a stepwise manner that allows the construction of models for an entire family of cations, with alkyl side chains of different length, for example. Due to the transferability of the present force field, the ions studied here can be combined with those reported in our two previous publications to create a large variety of ionic liquids that can be studied by molecular simulation. The parameters reported were obtained through different series of ab initio calculations concerning the geometry, force constants, torsion energy profiles, and electrostatic charge distributions of the ions under study. Validation of the force field consisted of comparison with experimental crystal structure and liquid density data.},

abstract = {The suitability of zeolites for a certain application strongly depends on their structural features. Among the types of shape selectivity, there is the still quite unexplored "cage or window effect" consisting of an unusual nonmonotonic increase of the Henry coefficient with chain length in cagelike zeolites when the guest hydrocarbon becomes too long to fit comfortably inside the wider part of the cages. This phenomenon has been addressed for alkanes in various zeolites, but a study dealing with alkenes is lacking. Because of both scientific interest and the impact on the petrochemical industry, we aimed at assessing window effects for a variety of alkenes regarding the position and number of the double bond. We used advanced molecular simulation techniques and considered the rigid all-silica channel-like OFF and cagelike ERL CHA, and ITQ-29 zeolites. Our study reveals results similar to those of alkanes when the double bond is located at the chain extremes. Conversely, less molecular flexibility induced by intermediate positions of the double bond or the presence of more than one bond lead to a weakness of the window effect, except for the ITQ:29 because of its considerably larger cage. These findings result in significant values of this type of selectivity for separations of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons with chain lengths commensurate with the zeolite cages.},

abstract = {We have used two different force field models to study concentrated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-water solutions by molecular dynamics. The results of these simulations are shown to compare well with recent neutron diffraction experiments using H/D isotope substitution [A. K. Soper and A. Luzar, J. Chem. Phys. 97, 1320 (1992)]. Even for the highly concentrated 1 DMSO: 2 H2O solution, the water hydrogen-hydrogen radial distribution function, g(HH)(r), exhibits the characteristic tetrahedral ordering of water-water hydrogen bonds. Structural information is further obtained from various partial atom-atom distribution functions, not accessible experimentally. The behavior of water radial distribution functions, g(OO)(r) and g(OH)(r) indicate that the nearest neighbor correlations among remaining water molecules in the mixture increase with increasing DMSO concentration. No preferential association of methyl groups on DMSO is detected. The pattern of hydrogen bonding and the distribution of hydrogen bond lifetimes in the simulated mixtures is further investigated. Molecular dynamics results show that DMSO typically forms two hydrogen bonds with water molecules. Hydrogen bonds between DMSO and water molecules are longer lived than water-water hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bond lifetimes determined by reactive flux correlation function approach are about 5 and 3 ps for water-DMSO and water-water pairs, respectively, in 1 DMSO: 2 H2O mixture. In contrast, for pure water, the hydrogen bond lifetime is about 1 ps. We discuss these times in light of experimentally determined rotational relaxation times. The relative values of the hydrogen bond lifetimes are consistent with a statistical (i.e., transition state theory) interpretation.},

The processes of breaking and making hydrogen bonds in tile condensed phase can be probed indirectly by a variety of experimental techniques(8), and more quantitative information can be obtained from computer simulations(9). In particular, simulations have revealed that on long timescales the relaxation behaviour of hydrogen bonds in liquid water exhibit non-exponential kinetics(7,10-13), suggesting that bond making and breaking are not simple processes characterized by well defined rate constants. Here we show that these kinetics can be understood in terms of an interplay between diffusion and hydrogen-bond dynamics. In our model, which can be extended to other hydrogen-bonded liquids, diffusion governs whether a specific pair of water molecules are near neighbours, and hydrogen bonds between such pairs form and persist at random with average lifetimes determined by rate constants for bond making and breaking.},

Molecular simulations based on classical potentials have played an important role in helping researchers understand how condensed phase properties of these materials are linked to chemical structure and composition. Simulations have also predicted many properties and unexpected phenomena that have subsequently been confirmed experimentally. The beneficial impact molecular simulations have had on this field is due in large part to excellent timing. Just when computing power and simulation methods matured to the point where complex fluids could be studied in great detail, a new class of materials virtually unknown to experimentalists came on the scene and demanded attention. This topical review explores some of the history of ionic liquid molecular simulations, and then gives examples of the recent use of molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulation in understanding the structure of ionic liquids, the sorption of small molecules in ionic liquids, the nature of ionic liquids in the vapor phase and the dynamics of ionic liquids. This review concludes with a discussion of some of the outstanding problems facing the ionic liquid modeling community and how condensed phase molecular simulation experts not presently working on ionic liquids might help advance the field.},

The diffusion coefficients of iodide/tri-iodide redox mediator in mixture of RTIL and acetonitrile have been studied by voltammetry and MD. Both experiment and simulation show a 2 orders of magnitude decrease of the diffusion coefficient of the redox mediator between pure acetonitrile and pure RTIL. However, the variation of the diffusion coefficient with the RTIL/acetonitrile mixing ratio shows that a small amount of acetonitrile is sufficient to induce an improvement of the ion transport properties of the electrolyte, which can be very beneficial to design efficient and stable electrolytes for DSCs.},

The power spectrum is obtained from averaged atomic velocity autocorrelation functions. In order to characterize the response of these liquids upon external Coulomb perturbation, a diatomic probe is used in an electronic photo-excitation computational experiment. We find that the radial distribution functions that couple anions and cations are more structured when alkyl substituent chains are longer. We also find that diffusion constants for anions and their corresponding cations are highly correlated. Cavity distributions are nearly identical for all solvents studied. We find that large cavities, if present in the liquid, have very long lifetimes.

abstract = {Adequate initial configurations for molecular dynamics simulations consist of arrangements of molecules distributed in space in such a way to approximately represent the system's overall structure. In order that the simulations are not disrupted by large van der Waals repulsive interactions, atoms from different molecules Must keep safe pairwise distances. Obtaining Such a molecular arrangement can be considered it packing problem: Each type molecule must satisfy spatial constraints related to the geometry of the system, and the distance between atoms of different molecules Must be greater than some specified tolerance. We have developed a code able to pack millions of atoms. grouped in arbitrarily complex molecules, inside a variety of three-dimensional regions. The regions may be intersections of spheres, ellipses, cylinders, planes, or boxes. The user must provide only the structure of one molecule of each type and the geometrical constraints that each type of molecule must satisfy. Building complex mixtures, interfaces, solvating biomolecules in water, other solvents, or mixtures of solvents, is straight forward. In addition. different atoms belonging to the same molecule may also be restricted to different spatial regions, in Such a way that more ordered molecular arrangements call be built, as micelles. lipid double-layers, etc. The packing time for state-of-the-art molecular dynamics systems varies front a few seconds to a few Minutes in a personal Computer. The input files are simple and Currently compatible with PDB, Tinker, Molden, or Moldy coordinate files.

abstract = {Explanations for the anomalously high mobility of protons in liquid water began with Grotthuss's idea(1,2) of structural diffusion' nearly two centuries ago. Subsequent explanations have refined this concept by invoking thermal hopping(3,4), proton tunnelling(5,6) or solvation effects(7). More recently, two main structural models have emerged for the hydrated proton. Eigen(8,9) proposed the formation of an H9O4+ complex in which an H3O+ core is strongly hydrogen-bonded to three H2O molecules. Zundel(10,11), meanwhile, supported the notion of an H5O2+ complex in which the proton is shared between two H2O molecules. Here we use ab initio path integral(12-14) simulations to address this question, These simulations include time-independent equilibrium thermal and quantum fluctuations of all nuclei, and determine interatomic interactions from the electronic structure. We find that the hydrated proton forms a fluxional defect in the hydrogen-bonded network with both H9O4+ and H5O2+ occurring only in the sense of 'limiting' or 'ideal' structures. The defect can become delocalized over several hydrogen bonds owing to quantum fluctuations. Solvent polarization induces a small barrier to proton transfer, which is washed out by zero-point motion. The proton can consequently be considered part of a 'low-barrier hydrogen bond'(15,16), in which tunnelling is negligible and the simplest concepts of transition-state theory do not apply. The rate of proton diffusion is determined by thermally induced hydrogen-bond breaking in the second solvation shell.},

We describe here sodium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) amide (NaNTf2) electrolyte systems based on 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) amide (C4mpyrNTf2) ionic liquids. The electrochemical stability of the system was examined; a pair of facile cathodic and anodic processes around 0 V vs. Na/Na+ were observed in cyclic voltammetry measurements and interpreted as deposition and dissolution of sodium metal. Density, viscosity and conductivity of the electrolytes were studied. It was found that the ionic conductivity of electrolytes reached as high as 8 mS/cm, decreasing slowly as the salt content increased due to increasing of viscosity and density of the electrolyte. Therefore, sodium electrolytes based on C4mpyrNTf2 appear to be promising for secondary sodium battery applications. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Glass transition temperature is one of the main criteria for the evaluation of the potential options for electrolyte application. In this communication, the attention was focused on the prediction of glass transition temperature of 1,3-dialkyl imidazolium ionic liquids which could be considered as potential future electrolytes. For this purpose, the quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) method is employed to develop two models for determination of glass transition temperature. In this study, both anion and cation descriptors are taken into account for model development. In the first part of this study, genetic function approximation is applied for model's parameter selection. In order to study the nonlinear relations between the selected molecular descriptors and the glass transition temperature, least square support vector machines (LSSVM) was successfully applied in second part of this study. Furthermore, the genetic algorithm (GA) optimization methods are respectively implemented to optimize the LSSVM model parameters. Consequently, we obtain two predictive models with satisfactory results qualified by the following statistical parameters: absolute average deviations of the predicted properties from existing experimental values by the GFA linear equation: 2.68{\%}, squared correlation coefficient: 0.91 and root mean square : 5.717 K and 1.38{\%} and 0.97 and 4.05 K evaluated by the LSSVM-QSPR model, respectively.},

We observe the transition of those mixtures from pure IL to aqueous solution by analyzing the changes in important bulk properties (density) and structural and bonding properties (radial distribution functions, water clustering, hydrogen bonding, and cationic stacking) as well as dynamical properties (diffusion coefficients) at 12 different concentration samplings of each mixture, ranging from 0.0 to 99.95 mol {\%} water. Our simulations revealed across all of the different structural, bonding, and dynamical properties major structural changes consistent with a transition from IL water mixture to aqueous solution in all three ILs at water concentrations around 75 mol {\%}. Among the structural changes observed were rapid increase in the frequency of hydrogen bonds, both water water and water-anion. Similarly, at these critical concentrations, the water clusters formed begin to span the entire simulation box, rather than existing as isolated networks of molecules. At the same time, there is a sudden decrease in cationic stacking at the transition point, followed by a rapid increase near 90 mol {\%} water. Finally, the diffusion coefficients of individual cations and anions show a rapid transition from rates consistent with diffusion in IL's to rates consistent with diffusion in water beginning at 75 mol {\%} water. The location of this transition is consistent, for [bmim]Cl and [dmim][DMP], with the water concentration limit above which the ILs are unable to dissolve cellulose.},

The device is based on a 10-mu-m-thick, optically transparent film of titanium dioxide particles a few nanometres in size, coated with a monolayer of a charge-transfer dye to sensitize the film for light harvesting. Because of the high surface area of the semiconductor film and the ideal spectral characteristics of the dye, the device harvests a high proportion of the incident solar energy flux (46{\%}) and shows exceptionally high efficiencies for the conversion of incident photons to electrical current (more than 80{\%}). The overall light-to-electric energy conversion yield is 7.1-7.9{\%} in simulated solar light and 12{\%} in diffuse daylight.

abstract = {The response of a room temperature molten salt to an external electric field when it is confined to a nanoslit is studied by molecular dynamics simulations. The fluid is confined between two parallel and oppositely charged walls, emulating two electrified solid-liquid interfaces. Attention is focused on structural, electrostatic, and dynamical properties, which are compared with those of the nonpolarized fluid. It is found that the relaxation of the electrostatic potential, after switching the electric field off, occurs in two stages. A first, subpicosecond process accounts for 80{\%} of the decay and is followed by a second subdiffusive process with a time constant of 8 ps. Diffusion is not involved in the relaxation, which is mostly driven by small anion translations. The relaxation of the polarization in the confined system is discussed in terms of the spectrum of charge density fluctuations in the bulk.},

abstract = {The behavior of a model ionic liquid (IL) confined between two flat parallel walls was studied at various interwall distances using computer simulations. The results focus both on structural and dynamical properties. Mass and charge density along the confinement axis reveal a structure of layers parallel to the walls that leads to an oscillatory profile in the electrostatic potential. Orientational correlation functions indicate that cations at the interface orient tilted with respect to the surface and that any other orientational order is lost thereafter. The diffusion coefficients of the ions exhibit a maximum as a function of the confinement distance, a behavior that results from a combination of the structure of the liquid as a whole and a faster molecular motion in the vicinity of the walls. We discuss the relevance of the present results and elaborate on topics that need further attention regarding the effects of ILs in the functioning of IL-based dye-sensitized solar cells.},

abstract = {Motivation: Molecular simulation has historically been a low-throughput technique, but faster computers and increasing amounts of genomic and structural data are changing this by enabling large-scale automated simulation of, for instance, many conformers or mutants of biomolecules with or without a range of ligands. At the same time, advances in performance and scaling now make it possible to model complex biomolecular interaction and function in a manner directly testable by experiment. These applications share a need for fast and efficient software that can be deployed on massive scale in clusters, web servers, distributed computing or cloud resources. Results: Here, we present a range of new simulation algorithms and features developed during the past 4 years, leading up to the GROMACS 4.5 software package. The software now automatically handles wide classes of biomolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, and comes with all commonly used force fields for these molecules built-in. GROMACS supports several implicit solvent models, as well as new free-energy algorithms, and the software now uses multithreading for efficient parallelization even on low-end systems, including windows-based workstations. Together with hand-tuned assembly kernels and state-of-the-art parallelization, this provides extremely high performance and cost efficiency for high-throughput as well as massively parallel simulations.},

A new method is used to compute gas compositions from a known temperature, bubble-point pressure, and liquid composition. Monte Carlo simulations are used to calculate the bubble-points of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) mixtures in the ionic liquids (ILs) 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [bmim][Tf2N] and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium diethylphosphate [emim][ depi. The Continuous Fractional Component Monte Carlo (CFCMC) method in the osmotic ensemble has been used to compute the solubility of CO2/CH4 gas mixtures at different temperatures (T), pressures (P), and gas compositions (y(i)). The effect of T, P, and y(i) on the real CO2/CH4 selectivity (i.e., the selectivity of CO2 in the presence of CH4) is investigated. The real selectivity will differ from the ideal selectivity, which is defined as the ratio of the Henry's constants, if the solubility of CO2 is influenced by the presence of CH4. The computed real selectivities are compared with the experimentally obtained real and ideal selectivities. The real CO2/CH4 selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and pressure, while the gas phase composition has a minor effect. The real selectivity is approximately identical to the ideal selectivity for relatively low pressures and low solute concentrations in the liquid phase. The real selectivity deviates from the ideal selectivity as the solute concentration in the liquid phase increases. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this work, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the influence of various water concentrations on nanostructural properties of the 1-heicyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [Hmim][NTf2] IL. An examination of molecular interactions in [Hmim][NTf2] IL-water mixtures shows the following trends: (a) At low water concentration, small regions of water molecules are surrounded by several cation-anion pairs. (b) At medium water concentration, cation tail aggregation starts, and phase separation between the IL and water is observed. (c) At high water concentration, increasing cationic tail aggregation leads to micelle formation. Further aggregates of cations and anions are solvated by large water channels. The radial distribution functions show that cation-anion, cation-cation, and anion-anion interactions decrease and water-water interaction increases with water concentration. The hydrogen bonding interactions occur between the acidic hydrogen of the positively charged imidazolium cation with the nitrogen and oxygen atoms of the anions. However, no hydrogen bonding interactions are seen between water molecules and the hydrophobic anions.},

When used with other methods for treating long-ranged interactions, the model is considerably less accurate. With small modifications, a new TIP5P-like potential can be made which is very accurate for liquid water when used with Ewald sums, a more physical and increasingly more commonly used method for treating long-ranged electrostatic interactions. The new model demonstrates a density maximum near 4degreesC, like the TIP5P model, and otherwise is similar to the TIP5P model for thermodynamic, dielectric, and dynamical properties of liquid water over a range of temperatures and densities. An analysis of this and other commonly used water models reveals how the quadrupole moment of a model can influence the dielectric response of liquid water. (C) 2004 American Institute of Physics.},

The concentration depth profiles of the elements in the sample were determined at three different water concentrations and show that small amounts of water affect the charge distribution in the ionic liquid along the surface normal. At low water concentrations (2500 ppm) the cation shows a strong presence at the surface with the alkyl chains oriented towards the gas phase, followed by a layer of anions below the alkyl chains of the cation. At higher water content (6000 to 10 000 ppm) the chloride anion shows an increased concentration at the ionic liquid surface while the alkyl chains move towards the bulk showing that the surface charge becomes more negative with increasing water content.

Two oxidation peaks were observed. The first peak is assigned to the oxidation of iodide to triiodide, in an overall two-electron process: 3I(-)- 2e(-) -{\textgreater} I-3(-). At higher potentials, the electrogenerated triiodide oxidizes to iodine, in an overall one-electron process: I-3(-) - e(-) -{\textgreater} 3/2I(2). An average diffusion coefficient, D, for I- of 1.55 x 10(-11) m(2) s(-1) was obtained. A digital simulation program was used to simulate the voltammetric response, and kinetic parameters were successfully extracted. The parameters deduced from the simulation include D for I-, I-3(-), and I-2 and K-eq,K-2, the equilibrium constant for the reaction of iodide and iodine to form triiodide. Values for these parameters are of the same order as those previously published for the oxidation of Br- in the same RTIL [Allen et al. J. Electroanal. Chem. 2005, 575, 311]. Next, the cyclic voltammetry of five different inorganic iodide salts was studied by dissolving small amounts of the solid in [C(4)mim][NTf2]. Similar oxidation peaks were observed, revealing diffusion coefficients of ca. 0.55, 1.14, 1.23, 1.44, and 1.33 x 10(-11) m(2) s(-1) and solubilities of 714, 246, 54, 83, and 36 mM for LiI, NaI, KI, RbI, and CsI, respectively. The slightly smaller diffusion coefficients for the XI salts (compared to [C(4)mim]I) may indicate that I- is ion-paired with Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+ in the RTIL medium.},

abstract = {Water interactions in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([emim][CH3COO]) were studied utilizing classical and ab initio simulation methods. The self-diffusivities for water and the ionic liquid (IL) were studied experimentally using pulse field gradient NMR spectroscopy and correlated with computational results. Water forms hydrogen bonding networks with the ionic liquid, and depending on the concentration of water, there are profound effects on the self-diffusivities of the various species. Both simulation and experiments show that the self-diffusivities for species in the water-[emim][CH3COO] system exhibit minima at 40-50 mol{\%} water. Water interaction with the [CH3COO](-) anion predominates over the water-water and water-cation interactions at most water concentrations. Simulations further indicate that decreasing water-[CH3COO](-) interaction will increase the IL and water self-diffusivities. Self-diffusivities in the water-IL systems are dependent upon the cation in a complex way. Water interactions with [P-4444][CH3COO] are reduced compared to [emim][CH3COO]. The [P-4444](+) cation is bulkier than the [emim](+) cation and has a smaller self-diffusivity, but when water was introduced to [P-4444] [CH3COO], the water-[CH3COO](-) hydrogen bonding network in the [P-4444][CH3COO] was much smaller than the one observed in [emim][CH3COO].},

The questions of water/IL phase separation and properties of the neat interface are addressed, comparing different liquid models (TIP3P vs TIP5P water and +1.0/-1.0 vs +0.9/-0.9 charged IL ions), the Ewald vs the reaction field treatments of the long range electrostatics, and different starting conditions. With the different models, the "randomly" mixed liquids separate much more slowly (in 20 to 40 ns) than classical water-oil mixtures do (typically, in less than 1 ns), finally leading to distinct nanoscopic phases separated by an interface, as in simulations which started with a preformed interface, but the IL phase is more humid. The final state of water in the IL thus depends on the protocol and relates to IL heterogeneities and viscosity. Water mainly fluctuates in hydrophilic basins (rich in O(Tf2N) and aromatic CH( BMI) groups), separated by more hydrophobic domains (rich in CF3(Tf2N) and alkyl(BMI) groups), in the form of monomers and dimers in the weakly humid IL phase, and as higher aggregates when the IL phase is more humid. There is more water in the IL than IL in water, to different extents, depending on the model. The interface is sharper and narrower (similar to 10 angstrom) than with the less hydrophobic [BMI][PF6] IL and is overall neutral, with isotropically oriented molecules, as in the bulk phases. The results allow us to better understand the analogies and differences of aqueous interfaces with hydrophobic (but hygroscopic) ILs, compared to classical organic liquids.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulation was used to investigate the dynamics of the ionic liquid [BMIM+][PF6-] when confined inside an uncharged slit-like graphitic pore of width H = 5.4 nm, in the temperature range 300-400 K. Our results indicate that the dynamics of the confined ions are highly heterogeneous and depend strongly on the distance of the ions with the pore walls. The ions in the center regions of the pore have dynamics and relaxation times that are very similar to those observed in a bulk IL at the same temperature. In contrast, the dynamics slow down appreciably as the ions get closer to the pore walls, and their relaxation times increase markedly. The overall diffusivities in the parallel (x,y) direction for the confined ions are found to be always smaller than the bulk diffusivities. Our results also suggest that these dynamical heterogeneities are linked to differences in structural properties. Radial distribution functions suggest that the structure of the ions in the center of the pore is similar to that observed in the bulk IL; however, significant structural differences are observed between the ions near the pore walls and those in the center of the pore.},

An unusual, isobaric approach to adsorption measurements and simulations was applied. Good agreement between the experimental and calculated data observed for MFI indicates that the QE-TPDA is a reliable method for studying porosity-related adsorptive properties of molecular sieves. The calculated average occupation profiles confirmed limited mobility of hexane and heptane molecules adsorbed in the sinusoidal channels on the MFI, thus proving the concept of orderâdisorder phase transition postulated in explanation of the two-step desorption profiles of these alkanes observed for MFI zeolites. Partial agreement of the calculated isobars with the experimental data found for zeolite MEL indicated that adsorption of n-alkanes in this structure is more complex than assumed in the simulation model. However, two-step desorption profiles and immobilization of the molecules adsorbed in the straight channels of the MEL structure were also found for hexane.},

abstract = {A "complex salt" of cetyltrimethylammonium (CTA(+)) with short (30 repeating units) polyacrylate (PA(-)) counterions has been synthesized. The phase diagrams of its aqueous mixtures with either the surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium acetate (CTAAc), or the polyelectrolyte NaPA, have been studied by visual inspection through crossed polarizers and by small-angle X-ray scattering. Both of the ternary phase diagrams are strikingly simple, containing only micellar, cubic micellar, and hexagonal phases. In the CTAPA/CTAAc/water system, the surfactant forms essentially spherical micelles above ca. 50 wt {\%} of water, regardless of the counterion composition, and the system may serve as a model for charged colloids with mixed monovalent/polymeric counterions. The interactions between micelles varies from repulsive to attractive as the fraction of monovalent counterions is decreased. This results, first, in a liquid-liquid phase separation between a concentrated branch and a dilute branch of the micellar phase and, finally, a crystallization of micelles into a cubic (Pm3n) phase in equilibrium with essentially pure water. Small fractions of polymeric counterions "melt" the cubic phase. This is attributed to heterogeneity: A small proportion of micelle pairs that share polymeric counterions experience strong attractions. In CTAPA/NaPA/water mixtures, the micelle-micelle interactions switch from attractive to repulsive as the NaPA content is increased. A similar effect occurs with added NaAc. Monte Carlo simulations of interactions between surfactant aggregates neutralized by mixed polymeric and monovalent counterions qualitatively reproduce all experimental trends and show that the dominating source of the attraction between the aggregates is polyion bridging.},

abstract = {Despite the fact that an enormous literature has now accumulated on the structure in liquid water, the focus has been primarily limited to the average radial distributions of particles; local (atomic) pair-density maps which span both the radial and the angular coordinates of the separation vector have remained largely unexplored. In this work, we have obtained the spatial distribution functions g(OO)o(rOMEGA) and g(OH)(r,OMEGA) for liquid water and have applied them to an analysis of the equilibrium structure. Molecular dynamics simulations of SPC/E water have been carried out at temperatures of - 10, 25, and 100-degrees-C and the local liquid structure examined. It is found that the unfolded 0 ... 0 distribution demonstrates, in addition to peaks consistent with a continuous tetrahedral network pattern, a distinct maximum in the local atomic pair density at ''interstitial'' separations of about 3.5 angstrom. This local maximum is lost in the spatially folded radial distribution function g(OO)(r) due to averaging over the entire angular space. By examining the peaks in g(OO)(r,OMEGA) due to nearest neighbors, we have shown that the tetrahedral network coordination number in liquid SPC/E water equals 4.0 and does not depend on temperature. The average number of molecules in additional nontetrahedral coordination, which is found to vary with temperature, has also been extracted, enabling us to establish full average coordination numbers of 4.8-5.0 in the temperature range of -10-100-degrees-C. In addition, we have determined and analyzed statistical distributions for the pair energies and H-bond angles for different water fractions as identified from g(OO)(r,OMEGA) and g(OH)(r,OMEGA).},

The temperature dependencies of the self-diffusion coefficient, viscosity, ionic conductivity, and molar conductivity have been fitted to the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman equation, and the best-fit parameters for the self-diffusion coefficient, viscosity, ionic conductivity, and molar conductivity have been estimated, together with the linear fitting parameters for the density. The self-diffusion coefficients determined for the individual ions by pulsed-field-gradient spin-echo NMR method exhibit higher values for the cation compared with the anion over a wide temperature range, even if its radius is larger than that of the anionic radii.

The influence of a series of anions on the solubility of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tricyanomethane in aqueous environment was here studied. This study aims at gathering further information to evaluate the recently proposed(1,2) mechanisms of salting-in- and salting-out-inducing ions in aqueous solutions of ILs and to provide insights at the molecular-level on the phenomena occurring in these systems. The observed effect of the inorganic species on the aqueous solubility of the ionic liquid qualitatively follows the Hofmeister series, and it is dependent on the nature and concentration of the anions. The liquid-liquid equilibrium data and (1)H NMR results here reported support a model according to which salting-in- and salting-out-inducing ions operate by essentially different mechanisms. While salting-out is an entropically driven effect resulting from the formation of hydration complexes and the increase of the surface tension of cavity formation, the salting-in phenomena is a consequence of the direct binding of the ions to the hydrophobic moieties of the IL. Further evidence here obtained suggests that the interactions of the inorganic ions are not only established with the cation of the IL, but also with the anion, with the observed solubility effect the result of a balance between those two types of interactions.},

Dynamic light scattering (DLS), cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, and atom-scale molecular dynamics simulations are used to shed light on the main interactions governing the formation of the aggregates and their composition. At high concentration, mixed micelles are formed with a composition that depends on the imidazolium alkyl chain length. For the shortest alkyl chain, micelles are mainly composed of ibuprofenate anions with some imidazolium cations intercalated between the anions. Upon increasing the alkyl chain length, the composition of the aggregates gets enriched in imidazolium cations and aggregates of stoichiometric composition are obtained. Attractive interactions between these aggregates led to the formation of larger aggregates. As suggested by molecular simulations, these larger aggregates might constitute the early stage of phase separation. Transitions from micelles to vesicles or ribbons are observed due to dilution effects and changes in the chemical composition of the aggregates. We also show that aggregation can be probed using simple microscopic quantities such as radial distribution functions and average solvation numbers.},

This would be expected. However, it is the details and subtleties of these structural changes that have not been understood. In this article, it is shown how non-hydrogen-bonded second neighbor considerations can be used to explain these structural changes.

By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily Customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License.

abstract = {Aqueous solutions of ionic liquids are of special interest, due to the distinctive properties of ionic liquids, in particular, their amphiphilic character. A better understanding of the structure-property relationships of such systems is hence desirable. One of the crucial molecular-level interactions that influences the macroscopic behavior is hydrogen bonding. In this work, we conduct molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the effects of ionic liquids on the hydrogen-bond network of water in dilute aqueous solutions of ionic liquids with various combinations of cations and anions. Calculations are performed for imidazolium-based cations with alkyl chains of different lengths and for a variety of anions, namely, [Br](-), [NO3](-), [SCN](-), [BF4](-), [PF6](-), and [Tf2N](-). The structure of water and the water-ionic liquid interactions involved in the formation of a heterogeneous network are analyzed by using radial distribution functions and hydrogen-bond statistics. To this end, we employ the geometric criterion of the hydrogen-bond definition and it is shown that the structure of water is sensitive to the amount of ionic liquid and to the anion type. In particular, [SCN](-) and [Tf2N](-) were found to be the most hydrophilic and hydrophobic anions, respectively. Conversely, the cation chain length did not influence the results.},

We study these processes using hydrated nanoporous materials and explore the use of solvents as alternative to improve the performance of these materials. We used boronate ester covalent organic frameworks (COF-5, -6, -10, and -102) because of their stability upon water. The best separation for hydrated structure is obtained with COF-102. However, the improvement on the separation performance requires a high percentage of hydration, reducing the capacity of the structure. To overcome this limitation, we suggest to introduce room-temperature ionic liquid as a solvent.

abstract = {Compositional effects on the charge-transport properties of electrolytes for batteries based on room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are well-known. However, further understanding is required about the molecular origins of these effects, in particular regarding the replacement of Li by Na. In this work, we investigate the use of RTILs in batteries, by means of both classical molecular dynamics (MD), which provides information about structure and molecular transport, and abâinitio molecular dynamics (AIMD), which provides information about structure. The focus has been placed on the effect of adding either Na(+) or Li(+) to 1-methyl-1-butyl-pyrrolidinium [C4 PYR](+) bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide [Tf2 N](-) . Radial distribution functions show excellent agreement between MD and AIMD, which ensures the validity of the force fields used in the MD. This is corroborated by the MD results for the density, the diffusion coefficients, and the total conductivity of the electrolytes, which reproduce remarkably well the experimental observations for all studied Na/Li concentrations. By extracting partial conductivities, it is demonstrated that the main contribution to the conductivity is that of [C4 PYR](+) and [Tf2 N](-) . However, addition of Na(+) /Li(+) , although not significant on its own, produces a dramatic decrease in the partial conductivities of the RTIL ions. The origin of this indirect effect can be traced to the modification of the microscopic structure of the liquid as observed from the radial distribution functions, owing to the formation of [Na(Tf2 N)n ]((n-1)-) and [Li(Tf2 N)n ]((n-1)-) clusters at high concentrations. This formation hinders the motion of the large ions, hence reducing the total conductivity. We demonstrate that this clustering effect is common to both Li and Na, showing that both ions behave in a similar manner at a microscopic level in spite of their distinct ionic radii. This is an interesting finding for extending Li-ion and Li-air technologies to their potentially cheaper Na-based counterparts.},

The electrolyte, consisting of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide, 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (MPII), and iodine, was examined at varying ionic liquid molar ratio and fixed iodine concentration, as well as at fixed ionic liquid molar ratio and varying iodine concentration. All measurements were conducted at controlled temperature over a broad temperature range to analyse the electrolyte properties in view of thermal stress of the DSSC during later practical application. The triiodide diffusion coefficient increases with decreasing MPII concentration or increasing temperature, caused by decreasing electrolyte viscosity. Additionally, strong non-Stokesian behaviour over the whole ionic liquid mixing range was found, decreasing at higher temperatures. Photovoltaic measurements showed that the DSSC efficiency is limited by triiodide diffusion at low temperatures and low iodine concentrations whereas at high temperatures it is limited by recombination processes, leading to a maximum for DSSC efficiency at a certain temperature. The exchange between diffusion limitation of DSSC efficiency and limitation by recombination and therefore the maximum for DSSC efficiency is shifted to lower temperatures by increasing iodine concentration.

Instead, the rate enhancements were correlated with the dilution of hydrogen bonding by the added cations. This phenomenon was further examined by the use of 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([BMMIM][NTf2]) as a cosolvent and the use of Reichardt's dye to measure the extent of hydrogen bonding on solutes in these systems.

Micellization of the three ILs were certified by the above methods and aggregation number of micelles (N-agg) were determined by pyrene fluorescence quenching method. A comparison of C(n)mimBF(4) with different alkyl chain lengths shows that that the critical micelle concentration (cmc) decreased remarkably with the increase of alkyl chain length, but the surface tensions at cmc (gamma(cmc)) were approximately the same, except for that of C(16)mimBF(4). The effects of temperature, inorganic salt, and organic alcohols on the cmc of C(n)mimBF(4) (n = 12, 14, 16) aqueous solution were also investigated. The results showed that the cmc values assumed a trend of increase along with the increase of temperature, and decreased remarkably with the presence of inorganic salt. For alcohol-water systems at lower temperature, the cmc values increased with the presence of short chain alcohols (ethanol, 1-propanol), but decreased or were invariable with long chain alcohols (1-butanol, 1-pentanol). Finally, the micellization thermodynamic parameters (Delta G(m)(o), Delta H-m(o), Delta S-m(o)) of C(n)mimBF(4) (n = 12, 14, 16) showed that the micelle formation process of C(12)mimBF(4) was entropy-driven, and the micellization behavior of C(14)mimBF(4) and C(16)mimBF(4) was found to be an enthalpy-driven process in the investigated temperature range.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has been employed to study the nonequilibrium structure formation of two types of particles in a colloidal suspension, driven by type-dependent forces. We examined the time evolution of structure formation as well as on the structural properties of the resulting aggregation by studying the radial distribution function (RDF). The resulting aggregation is well described by a binary colloidal gelation. We compared the structural properties to those for one type of particles. From the MD results, it is evident that there are significant differences between the RDF's of the two cases. Moreover, we found that the average coordination number is generally larger in the monodisperse case for all area fractions considered. Thus, by means of heterogeneous aggregation, it is possible to obtain a wide variety of structures while more close-packed structures are formed for monodisperse colloidal aggregation.

Cyclic voltammetry indicated a stable sodium plating behavior with a current of 5 mA cm(-2) at 25 Â°C to 20 mA cm(-2) at 100 Â°C, along with high reversibility identifying this electrolyte as a possible candidate for sodium-ion or sodium metal battery applications.

Temperature dependent PFG-NMR diffusion measurements show that both FSI and NTf2 have a comparable behaviour although the smaller FSI anion is more diffusive.},

abstract = {Ionic liquids have been intensively investigated as alternative stable electrolyte solvents for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). A highest overall conversion efficiency of over 8{\%} has been achieved using a ionic-liquid-based electrolyte in combination with an iodide/triiodide redox couple. However, the relatively high viscosities of ionic liquids require higher iodine concentration in the electrolyte due to mass-transport limitations of the triiodide ions. The higher iodine concentration significantly reduces the photovoltaic performance, which normally are lower than those using organic solvent-based electrolytes. Here, the concept of incompletely solvated ionic liquid mixtures (ISILMs) is introduced and represents a conceptually new type of electrolyte solvent for DSCs. It is found that the photovoltaic performance of ISILM-based electrolytes can rival that of organic solvent-based electrolytes. Furthermore, the vapor pressures of ISILMs are found to be considerably lower than that for pure organic solvents. Stability tests show that ISILM-based electrolytes provide highly stable DSCs under light soaking conditions. Thus, ISILM-based electrolytes offer a new platform to develop more efficient and stable DSC devices of relevance to future large-scale applications.},

The internal reference method was adopted to obtain the concentration-dependent chemical shifts of -CH3 in N222NO3, which have been correlated using the H-1 NMR local composition (LC) model to obtain the local mole fractions. It has been revealed that within N222NO3 rich region, self-association of the ionic liquid was predominant instead of N222NO3-solvent interactions. However, in the solvent rich region, N222NO3 mainly interacts with solvent molecules, indicating that the self-association network of N222NO3 has been greatly destroyed by solvents. In addition, the different influences of DMSO and acetone have been detected. DMSO molecules more effectively destroy the original network of the ionic liquid, due to its higher dielectric constant. Also, LC behavior in N222NO3/DMSO systems is more significant than in N222NO3/acetone, indicating that DMSO can induce more obvious heterogeneities in DMSO/N222NO3 mixtures, which is consistent with physicochemical properties and cellulose solubility of solutions.},

Neutron and X-ray powder diffraction and single crystal X-ray diffraction experiments are used to unveil the site-specific binding properties of CO2 within many of these materials while systematically varying both the amount of CO2 and the temperature. Unlike previous studies, we show that CO2 adsorbed at the metal cations exhibits intramolecular angles with minimal deviations from 180Â°, a finding that indicates a strongly electrostatic and physisorptive interaction with the framework surface and sheds more light on the ongoing discussion regarding whether CO2 adsorbs in a linear or nonlinear geometry. This has important implications for proposals that have been made to utilize these materials for the activation and chemical conversion of CO2. For the weaker CO2 adsorbents, significant elongation of the metalâO(CO2) distances are observed and diffraction experiments additionally reveal that secondary CO2 adsorption sites, while likely stabilized by the population of the primary adsorption sites, significantly contribute to adsorption behavior at ambient temperature. Density functional theory calculations including van der Waals dispersion quantitatively corroborate and rationalize observations regarding intramolecular CO2 angles and trends in relative geometric properties and heats of adsorption in the M2(dobdc)âCO2 adducts.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to study the complex and heterogeneous dynamics of ions in ionic liquids. The dynamics of cations and anions in 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium nitrate (EMIM-NO(3)) are characterized by van Hove functions and the corresponding intermediate scattering functions F(s)(k,t) and elucidated by the trajectories augmented by the use of singular spectrum analysis (SSA). Several time regions are found in the mean squared displacement of the ions. Change in the slope in a plot of the diffusion coefficient against temperature is found at around 410 K in the simulation. Heterogeneous dynamics with the presence of both localized ions and fast ions capable of successive jumps were observed at long time scales in the self-part of the van Hove functions and in the trajectories. Non-Gaussian dynamics are evidenced by the self-part of the van Hove functions and wave number dependence of F(s)(k,t) and characterized as Levy flights. Successive motion of some ions can continue even after several nanoseconds at 370 K, which is longer than the onset time of diffusive motion, t(dif). Structure of the long time dynamics of fast ions is clarified by the phase space plot of the successive motion using the denoised data by SSA. The continual dynamics are shown to have a long term memory, and therefore local structure is not enough to explain the heterogeneity. The motion connecting localized regions at about 370 K is jumplike, but there is no typical one due to local structural changes during jump motion. With the local motion, mutual diffusion between cation and anion occurs. On decreasing temperature, mutual diffusion is suppressed, which results in slowing down of the dynamics. This "mixing effect of cation and anion" is compared with the "mixed alkali effect" found in the ionics in the ionically conducting glasses, where the interception of paths by different alkali metal ions causes the large reduction in the dynamics [J. Habasaki and K. L. Ngai, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 9, 4673 (2007), and references herein]. Although a similar mechanism of the slowing down is observed, strong coupling of the motion of cation and anion prevents complete interception unless deeply supercooled, and this explains the wide temperature region of the existence of the liquid and supercooled liquid states in the ionic liquid.},

abstract = {The self-aggregation behavior of the double-chained ionic liquid (IL) 1,3-didecyl-2-methylimidazolium chloride ([C10C10mim]Cl) in aqueous solution has been investigated with a number of different experimental techniques. Two cmc values (cmc1 and cmc2) are obtained from conductivity measurements. The fraction of neutralized charge on the micellar surface suggests that cmc1 corresponds to the formation of spherical micelles and cmc2 to the transition from spherical to cylindrical micelles. Data obtained from fluorescence spectroscopy (using pyrene and Nile red as chemical probes), fluorescence anisotropy (using rhodamine B as probe), and chemical shift (1)H NMR (in D2O) provide a picture that is also consistent with a sphere-to-cylinder transition. This structural change is further confirmed by diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY), from the self-diffusion coefficients for surfactant unimer and aggregates. Furthermore, a third evolution from cylindrical micelles to bilayer aggregates is proposed from the analysis of diffusion coefficients at high surfactant concentration ([IL] {\textgreater} 0.2 M). Phase scanning experiments performed with polarized light microscopy clearly demonstrate the presence of a lamellar liquid crystalline phase at very high IL concentration, thus confirming the coexistence of bilayer structures with elongated micelles, found at lower concentration. Additionally, [C10C10mim]Cl micelles are proposed as novel reaction media, as evidenced by the solvolysis reaction of 4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl chloride (MBSC).},

abstract = {We have performed extensive molecular dynamic simulations to analyze the influence of cation and anion natures, and of water concentration, on the structure and dynamics of water-1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium ionic liquid mixtures. The dependence on water concentration of the radial distribution functions, coordination numbers, and hydrogen bonding degree between the different species has been systematically analyzed for different lengths of the cation alkyl chain (alkyl = ethyl, butyl, hexyl, and octyl) and several counterions. These include two halogens of different sizes and positions in Hoffmeister series, Cl(-) and Br(-), and the highly hydrophobic inorganic anion PF(6)(-) throughout its whole solubility regime. The formation of water clusters in the mixture has been verified, and the influences of both anion hydrophobicity and cation chain length on the structure and size of these clusters have been analyzed. The water cluster size is shown to be relatively independent of the cation chain length, but strongly dependent on the hydrophobicity of the anion, which also determines critically the network formation of water and therefore the miscibility of the ionic liquid. The greater influence of the anion relative to the cation one is seen to be reflected in all the analyzed physical properties. Finally, single-particle dynamics in IL-water mixtures is considered, obtaining the self-diffusion coefficients and the velocity autocorrelation functions of water molecules in the mixture, and analyzing the effect of cation, anion, and water concentration on the duration of the ballistic regime and on the time of transition to the diffusive regime. Complex non-Markovian behavior was detected at intermediate times within an interval progressively shorter as water concentration increases.},

abstract = {Interactions between ionic liquid surfactant [C12mim]Br and DNA in dilute brine were investigated in terms of various experimental methods and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. It was shown that the aggregation of [C12mim]Br on DNA chains is motivated not only by electrostatic attractions between DNA phosphate groups and [C12mim]Br headgroups but also by hydrophobic interactions among [C12mim]Br alkyl chains. Isothermal titration calorimetry analysis indicated that the [C12mim]Br aggregation in the presence and absence of DNA are both thermodynamically favored driven by enthalpy and entropy. DNA undergoes size transition and conformational change induced by [C12mim]Br, and the charges of DNA are neutralized by the added [C12mim]Br. Various microstructures were observed such as DNA with loose coil conformation in nature state, necklace-like structures, and compact spherical aggregates. MD simulation showed that the polyelectrolyte collapses upon the addition of oppositely charged surfactants and the aggregation of surfactants around the polyelectrolyte was reaffirmed. The simulation predicted the gradual neutralization of the negatively charged polyelectrolyte by the surfactant, consistent with the experimental results. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Ethanol production in the U. S. has increased 36{\%} between 2006 and 2007 (J. M. Urbanchuk, Contribution of the Ethanol Industry to the Economy of the United States, LECG, LLC, Renewable Fuels Association, 2008) in response to a growing demand for its use as a commercial transportation fuel. 1-Butanol also shows potential as a liquid fuel but both alcohols require high energy consumption in separating them from water. 1-Butanol, in particular, is considered an excellent intermediate for making other chemical compounds from renewable resources, as well as being widely used as a solvent in the pharmaceutical industry. These alcohols can be synthesized from bio-feedstocks by fermentation, which results in low concentrations of the alcohol in water. To separate alcohol from water, conventional distillation is used, which is energetically intensive. The goal of this study is to show that, using an ionic liquid, extraction of the alcohol from water is possible. Through the development of ternary diagrams, separation coefficients are determined. The systems studied are 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide/ethanol/water, which exhibits Type 1 liquid-liquid equilibrium (LLE) behavior, and 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide/1-butanol/water, which exhibits Type 2 LLE behavior. Based on the phase diagrams, this ionic liquid (1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) can easily separate 1-butanol from water. It can also separate ethanol from water, but only when unreasonably high solvent/feed ratios are used. In addition, we use four excess Gibbs free energy (gE) models (NRTL, eNRTL, UNIQUAC and UNIFAC), with parameters estimated solely using binary data and/or pure component properties, to predict the behavior of the ternary LLE systems. None of the models adequately predicts the Type 1 system, but both UNIQUAC and eNRTL aptly predict the Type 2 system.},

Based on the classical Lopes-Padua force field trajectories of approximately 60 ns were computed. This is the third part of a series concerning the collective network of 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate/water mixtures. The first part [C. Schr{\"{o}}der et al., J. Chem. Phys. 127, 234503 (2007)] dealt with the orientational structure and static dielectric constants. The second part [C. Schr{\"{o}}der et al., J. Chem. Phys. 129, 184501 (2008)] was focused on the decomposition of the dielectric spectrum of these mixtures. In this work the focus lies on the characterization of the neighborhood of ionic liquids by means of the Voronoi decomposition. The Voronoi algorithm is a rational tool to uniquely decompose the space around a reference molecule without using any empirical parameters. Thus, neighborhood relations, direct and indirect ones, can be extracted and were used in combination with g-coefficients. These coefficients represent the generalization of the traditional radial distribution function in order to include the mutual positioning and orientation of anisotropic molecules. Furthermore, the Voronoi method provides, as a by-product, the mutual coordination numbers of molecular species.},

While some property values are in good agreement, some show large differences. These values will be compared and reasons for the discrepancies will be conjectured. Since traditional approaches to predicting the properties of fluid liquids require extensive LLE and VLE measurements, alternative predictive methods need to be explored.

Mixture simulations with lithium salt mole fractions between 0{\%} and 33{\%} at 363 and 423 K yield densities, ion self-diffusion coefficients, and ionic conductivities in very good agreement with available experimental data. In all investigated electrolytes, each Li(+) cation was found to be coordinated, on average, by 4.1 oxygen atoms from surrounding anions. At lower concentrations (x â¤ 0.20), the Li(+) cation was found to be, on average, coordinated by slightly more than three Ntf(2) anions with two anions contributing a single oxygen atom and one anion contributing two oxygen atoms to Li(+) coordination. At the highest [Li][Ntf(2)] concentration, however, there were, on average, 3.5 anions coordinating each Li(+) cation, corresponding to fewer bidendate and more monodentate anions in the Li(+) coordination sphere. This trend is due to increased sharing of anions by Li(+) at higher salt concentrations. In the [pyr(13)][Ntf(2)]/[Li][Ntf(2)] electrolytes, the ion diffusivity is significantly smaller than that in organic liquid electrolytes due to not only the greater viscosity of the solvent but also the formation of clusters resulting from sharing of anions by Li(+) cations. The ionic conductivity of the electrolytes was found to decrease with increasing salt concentration, with the effect being greater at the higher temperature. Finally, we found that the contribution of Li(+) to ionic conductivity does not increase proportionally to Li(+) concentration but saturates at higher doping levels.},

The liquid density, ion self-diffusion coefficients, and conductivity predicted by MD simulations were found to be in good agreement with experimental data, where available. MD simulations reveal that the Li(+) environment is similar in mppy(+)TFSI(-) and mmpy(+)TFSI(+) ILs doped with LiTFSI. The Li(+) cations were found to be coordinated on average by slightly less than four oxygen atoms with each oxygen atom being contributed by a different TFSI(-) anion. Significant lithium aggregation by sharing up to three TFSI(-) anions bridging two lithiums was observed, particularly at lower temperatures where the lithium aggregates were found to be stable for tens of nanoseconds. Polarization of TFSI(-) anions is largely responsible for the formation of such lithium aggregates. Li(+) transport was found to occur primarily by exchange of TFSI(-) anions in the first coordination shell with a smaller (approximately 30{\%}) contribution also due to Li(+) cations diffusing together with their first coordination shell. In both ILs, ion self-diffusion coefficients followed the order Li(+) {\textless} TFSI(-) {\textless} mmpy(+) or mppy(+) with all ion diffusion in mmpy(+)TFSI(-) being systematically slower than that in mppy(+)TFSI(-). Conductivity due to the Li(+) cation in LiTFSI doped mppy(+)TFSI(-) IL was found to be greater than that for a model poly(ethylene oxide)(PEO)/LiTFSI polymer electrolyte but significantly lower than that for an ethylene carbonate/LiTFSI liquid electrolyte. Finally, the time-dependent shear modulus for the LiTFSI doped ILs was found to be similar to that for a model poly(ethylene oxide)(PEO)/LiTFSI polymer electrolyte on the subnanosecond time scale.},

abstract = {A new density functional (DF) of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) type for general chemistry applications termed B97-D is proposed. It is based on Becke's power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C(6) x R(-6). A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common density functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported. The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on standard thermochemical benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked aromatic molecules and group II element clusters, and for the computation of molecular geometries. Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for standard functionals. In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean absolute deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol(-1). The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the average CCSD(T) accuracy. The basic strategy in the development to restrict the density functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interatomic distances by damped C(6) x R(-6) terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions. As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient and accurate quantum chemical method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance.},

Although several ionic liquids have been explored for use as electrolytes in Na secondary batteries, little is known about the transport properties of Na+ ions. In this study, the thermal and transport properties of Na[FSA]-[C3C1pyrr][FSA] (FSA?: bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide and C3C1pyrr+: N-methyl-N-propylpyrrolidinium) ionic liquids were investigated in order to determine their suitability for use as electrolytes in Na secondary batteries. In the x(Na[FSA]) range of 0.0?0.5 (x(Na[FSA]) = molar fraction of Na[FSA]), a wide liquid-phase temperature range was observed at close to room temperature. The viscosity and ionic conductivity of this system, which obey the Vogel?Tamman?Fulcher equation, increases and decreases, respectively, with an increase in x(Na[FSA]). Further, its viscosity and molar ionic conductivity satisfy the fractional Walden rule. The apparent transport number of Na+ in the investigated ionic liquids, as determined by the potential step method at 353 K, increases monotonously with an increase in x(Na[FSA]), going from 0.08 for x(Na[FSA]) = 0.1 to 0.59 for x(Na[FSA]) = 0.7. The Na+ ion conductivity, determined by multiplying the ionic conductivity with the apparent transport number, is an indicator of Na+ ion transport in Na secondary batteries and is high when x(Na[FSA]) is in the 0.2?0.4 range.

Atmospheric oxygen is used to form oxides during discharging, which-ideally-decompose reversibly during charging. Much work has been focused on aprotic Li-O(2) cells (mostly with carbonate-based electrolytes and Li(2)O(2) as a potential discharge product), where large overpotentials are observed and a complex cell chemistry is found. In fact, recent studies evidence that Li-O(2) cells suffer from irreversible electrolyte decomposition during cycling. Here we report on a Na-O(2) cell reversibly discharging/charging at very low overpotentials ({\textless} 200 mV) and current densities as high as 0.2 mA cm(-2) using a pure carbon cathode without an added catalyst. Crystalline sodium superoxide (NaO(2)) forms in a one-electron transfer step as a solid discharge product. This work demonstrates that substitution of lithium by sodium may offer an unexpected route towards rechargeable metal-air batteries.},

Standard solution based on alkyl carbonates and LiPF6 was examined in this respect for comparison. The ionic liquids (ILs) based on derivatives of piperidinium and pyrrolidinium demonstrate a very wide electrochemical window (up to 5.5V) and they can be compatible with lithium metal anodes. At low potentials in the presence of Li ions in solutions (or on Li metal surfaces), TFSI anions are reduced to insoluble Li compounds which passivate Li, noble metal and graphite electrodes in the Li salt/IL solutions. The mechanism, kinetics and effectiveness of electrodes' passivation in these systems depend on the nature of both IL and electrode used. It was possible to demonstrate reversible behavior of Li/LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 cells (4.8V) with solutions based on BMPTFSI and MPPpTFSI. Possible parasitic anodic reactions upon charging at the high potentials are much lower in the ILs than in standard solutions.},

Biology and biomimetic processes in ionic liquids are also discussed. In these decidedly different materials, some enzymes show activity that is not exhibited in more traditional systems, creating huge potential for bioinspired catalysis and biofuel cells.

abstract = {Some ionic liquids (ILs) based on pyrrolidinium cations, which are of interest for high-energy electrochemical storage devices, such as lithium batteries and supercapacitors, have a structure similar to that of surfactants and tend to form local aggregates. The investigated ILs consist of the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI) anion and pyrrolidinium-based cations having a methyl side chain and an ether (ethylmethoxy- or ethylethoxy-) side chain. For such, it is very important to understand if these IL cations tend to aggregate like surfactants because this would affect the ion mobility and thus the ionic conductivity. The aggregation behavior of these ILs was extensively studied with NMR and Raman methods also in the presence of Li(+) cations and compared with that of corresponding ILs having no ether group on the cation side chain. (2)H NMR spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation rates were analyzed by applying the "two step" model of surfactant dynamics. Here we show that whereas the ILs based on pyrrolidinium cations without ether functions tend to form aggregates in which the cations are surrounded by the anions, especially in the presence of lithium cations, those with an ether side chain are not aggregated.},

abstract = {Lithium salts dissolved in ionic liquids (ILs) are interesting alternatives to the commonly used electrolytes for Li-ion batteries. In this study, the solution of Li [bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide] (LiTFSI) in N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium TFSI (PYR14TFSI) ionic liquid in the 0.1:0.9 molar ratio is studied by heteronuclear NOE and NMR diffusion measurements. The main purpose is to spot on the interions organization and mobility. NOE data support the existence of strongly coordinated Li+ species, whereas variable temperature measurements of the self-diffusion coefficients D show large, selective, and unexpected enhancement of Li+ mobility with T. The measured activation energy for Li+ diffusion is significantly larger than those of TFSIâ{\`{a}}{\'{i}} and PYR14+. These findings can be related to the mechanism of Li+ diffusion in ILs based on disruption formation of the coordination shells of Li+ with TFSI anions rather than on the Brownian motion of the whole Li+ coordinated species.},

The liquid density, ion self-diffusion coefficients, and conductivity predicted by MD simulations were found to be in good agreement with experimental data, where available. MD simulations reveal that the Li(+) environment is similar in mppy(+)TFSI(-) and mmpy(+)TFSI(+) ILs doped with LiTFSI. The Li(+) cations were found to be coordinated on average by slightly less than four oxygen atoms with each oxygen atom being contributed by a different TFSI(-) anion. Significant lithium aggregation by sharing up to three TFSI(-) anions bridging two lithiums was observed, particularly at lower temperatures where the lithium aggregates were found to be stable for tens of nanoseconds. Polarization of TFSI(-) anions is largely responsible for the formation of such lithium aggregates. Li(+) transport was found to occur primarily by exchange of TFSI(-) anions in the first coordination shell with a smaller (approximately 30{\%}) contribution also due to Li(+) cations diffusing together with their first coordination shell. In both ILs, ion self-diffusion coefficients followed the order Li(+) {\textless} TFSI(-) {\textless} mmpy(+) or mppy(+) with all ion diffusion in mmpy(+)TFSI(-) being systematically slower than that in mppy(+)TFSI(-). Conductivity due to the Li(+) cation in LiTFSI doped mppy(+)TFSI(-) IL was found to be greater than that for a model poly(ethylene oxide)(PEO)/LiTFSI polymer electrolyte but significantly lower than that for an ethylene carbonate/LiTFSI liquid electrolyte. Finally, the time-dependent shear modulus for the LiTFSI doped ILs was found to be similar to that for a model poly(ethylene oxide)(PEO)/LiTFSI polymer electrolyte on the subnanosecond time scale.},

Mixture simulations with lithium salt mole fractions between 0{\%} and 33{\%} at 363 and 423 K yield densities, ion self-diffusion coefficients, and ionic conductivities in very good agreement with available experimental data. In all investigated electrolytes, each Li(+) cation was found to be coordinated, on average, by 4.1 oxygen atoms from surrounding anions. At lower concentrations (x â¤ 0.20), the Li(+) cation was found to be, on average, coordinated by slightly more than three Ntf(2) anions with two anions contributing a single oxygen atom and one anion contributing two oxygen atoms to Li(+) coordination. At the highest [Li][Ntf(2)] concentration, however, there were, on average, 3.5 anions coordinating each Li(+) cation, corresponding to fewer bidendate and more monodentate anions in the Li(+) coordination sphere. This trend is due to increased sharing of anions by Li(+) at higher salt concentrations. In the [pyr(13)][Ntf(2)]/[Li][Ntf(2)] electrolytes, the ion diffusivity is significantly smaller than that in organic liquid electrolytes due to not only the greater viscosity of the solvent but also the formation of clusters resulting from sharing of anions by Li(+) cations. The ionic conductivity of the electrolytes was found to decrease with increasing salt concentration, with the effect being greater at the higher temperature. Finally, we found that the contribution of Li(+) to ionic conductivity does not increase proportionally to Li(+) concentration but saturates at higher doping levels.},

We describe here sodium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) amide (NaNTf2) electrolyte systems based on 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) amide (C4mpyrNTf2) ionic liquids. The electrochemical stability of the system was examined; a pair of facile cathodic and anodic processes around 0 V vs. Na/Na+ were observed in cyclic voltammetry measurements and interpreted as deposition and dissolution of sodium metal. Density, viscosity and conductivity of the electrolytes were studied. It was found that the ionic conductivity of electrolytes reached as high as 8 mS/cm, decreasing slowly as the salt content increased due to increasing of viscosity and density of the electrolyte. Therefore, sodium electrolytes based on C4mpyrNTf2 appear to be promising for secondary sodium battery applications. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Understanding the properties of the solid electrolyte interphase (SET) of lithium batteries is important for minimizing interfacial resistance and improving battery safety and cycling. Ion transport has been investigated in the dilithium ethylene dicarbonate (Li2EDC) component of the SEI by impedance spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations employing a revised many-body polarizable APPLE{\&}P force field. The developed force field accurately described the binding energies in LiCH3CO3, its dimer, and Li2EDC calculated at the G4MP2 and MP2 levels. M05-2X and LC-omega PBE functionals predicted too high binding energy in lithium alkyl carbonates compared to the G4MP2 results, while the MP2 and M06-L predictions agreed well with the G4MP2 data. The conductivity of Li2EDC at room temperature was found to be 10(-9) S/cm from impedance measurements and extrapolation of MD simulation results. A near Arrhenius temperature dependence of Li2EDC's conductivity was found in the MD simulations with an activation energy ranging from 64 to 84 kJ/mol. At room temperature, the lithium transport was subdiffusive on time scales shorter than similar to 10(-2) s in MD simulations corresponding to the onset of the plateau of resistivity vs frequency occurring at frequencies lower than 10(2) Hz. The influence of Li2EDC ordering on the ion transport was investigated by contrasting supercooled amorphous melts and ordered material. At 393 K Li+ transport was heterogeneous, showing chainlike and looplike Li+ correlated displacements. The non-Gaussianity of Li+ transport was examined. The influence of polarization on the structure of the lithium coordination shell and ion transport has been investigated in the molten phase of Li2EDC and contrasted with the previous results obtained for room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs). Nonpolarizable Li2EDC exhibited orders of magnitude slower dynamics below 600 K and a higher activation energy for the Li+ diffusion coefficient. Initial simulations of Li2EDC dissolved in an EC:DMC(3:7)/LiPF6 liquid electrolyte were performed at 450 K and showed a strong aggregation of Li2EDC consistent with its phase separation from the electrolyte. The plasticizing effects of carbonate electrolyte on Li2EDC dynamics were examined.},

Structurally, Li(+) is shown to be solvated by three anion neighbors in [pyr14][TFSI] and four anion neighbors in both [pyr13][FSI] and [EMIM][BF4], and at all levels of xLi(+) we find the presence of lithium aggregates. Pulsed field gradient spin-echo NMR measurements of diffusion and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements of ionic conductivity are made for the neat ionic liquids as well as 0.5 molal solutions of Li-salt in the ionic liquids. Bulk ionic liquid properties (density, diffusion, viscosity, and ionic conductivity) are obtained with MD simulations and show excellent agreement with experiment. While the diffusion exhibits a systematic decrease with increasing xLi(+), the contribution of Li(+) to ionic conductivity increases until reaching a saturation doping level of xLi(+) = 0.10. Comparatively, the Li(+) conductivity of [pyr14][TFSI] is an order of magnitude lower than that of the other liquids, which range between 0.1 and 0.3 mS/cm. Our transport results also demonstrate the necessity of long MD simulation runs (â¼200 ns) to converge transport properties at room temperature. The differences in Li(+) transport are reflected in the residence times of Li(+) with the anions ($\tau$(Li/-)), which are revealed to be much larger for [pyr14][TFSI] (up to 100 ns at the highest doping levels) than in either [EMIM][BF4] or [pyr13][FSI]. Finally, to comment on the relative kinetics of Li(+) transport in each liquid, we find that while the net motion of Li(+) with its solvation shell (vehicular) significantly contributes to net diffusion in all liquids, the importance of transport through anion exchange increases at high xLi(+) and in liquids with large anions.},

The ?HÂ° and ?SÂ° suggest that the Li+ ion is coordinated by one of bidentate and two of monodentate FSA? at 298 K, and that the more weakly solvated monodentate FSA? is liberated at higher temperatures. The high-energy X-ray diffraction (HEXRD) experiments of these systems were carried out and were analyzed with the aid of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In radial distribution functions evaluated with HEXRD, a peak at about 1.94 {\AA} appeared and was attributable to the Li+?O(FSA?) correlations. The longer Li+?O(FSA?) distance than that for the Li+?O(TFSA?) of 1.86 {\AA} strongly supports the larger solvation number of the Li+ ions in the FSA? based ionic liquids. MD simulations at least qualitatively reproduced the Raman and HEXRD experiments.},

The polarizable force field calculations indicate that the lithium cations are coordinated by (T)FSI anion oxygens forming lithium adducts stabilized over a large temperature range by strong Li-O bonds. Lithium aggregation is found to be negligible at the doping level considered here (10{\%} mole fraction), and Li(+) diffusion occurs primarily by exchanging the (T)FSI anions in their first coordination shell. The resulting calculated transport properties are in good agreement with the corresponding nuclear magnetic resonance data.},

abstract = {The physicochemical properties of a range of NaNTf2 (or NaTFSI) salt concentrations in N-propyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (or C3mpyrFSI) ionic liquid were investigated by DSC, conductivity, cyclic voltammetry and diffusivity studies. Cyclic voltammetry indicated a stable sodium plating behavior with a current of 5 mA cm(-2) at 25 Â°C to 20 mA cm(-2) at 100 Â°C, along with high reversibility identifying this electrolyte as a possible candidate for sodium-ion or sodium metal battery applications. (23)Na NMR chemical shifts and spectral linewidths (FWHM) indicate a complex coordination of the Na(+) ion which is dependent on both temperature and salt concentration with an apparently stronger coordination to the NTf2 anion upon increasing the NaNTf2 concentration. Temperature dependent PFG-NMR diffusion measurements show that both FSI and NTf2 have a comparable behaviour although the smaller FSI anion is more diffusive.},

@article{Hamad2008a,
abstract = {The nature of glycine--glycine interactions in aqueous solution has been studied using molecular dynamics simulations at four different concentrations and, in each case, four different temperatures. Although evidence is found for formation of small, transient hydrogen-bonded clusters of glycine molecules, the main type of interaction between glycine molecules is found to be single NH...OC hydrogen bonds. Double-hydrogen-bonded "dimers", which have often been cited as a significant species present in aqueous solutions of glycine, are only observed infrequently. When double-hydrogen-bonded dimers are formed, they dissociate quickly (typically within less than ca. 4 ps), although the broken hydrogen bonds have a higher than average probability of reforming. Several aspects of the clustering of glycine molecules are investigated as a function of both temperature and concentration, including the size distribution of glycine clusters, the radii of gyration of the clusters, and aspects of the lifetimes of glycine-glycine hydrogen bonding by means of hydrogen-bond correlation functions. Diffusion coefficients for the glycine clusters and water molecules are also investigated and provide results in realistic agreement with experimental results.},

The effects of Na ion concentration (0-60 mol{\%} Na[FSA]) and operation temperature (253-363 K) on the viscosity and ionic conductivity and charge-discharge performance of Na/Na[FSA]-[C3C1pyrr][FSA]/NaCrO2 cells are studied. Results show that Na ion concentration strongly affects the rate capability of the cells, and that the best rate capability at 363 K is obtained at 40 mol{\%} Na[FSA]. The operation temperature also significantly influences the charge-discharge performance, especially at low temperatures. At operation temperatures below 273 K, 25 mol{\%} Na[FSA] is found to be the optimum Na ion concentration. There exist different optimum ranges of Na ion concentration depending on the operation temperatures. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We use molecular simulations to analyze the preferential adsorption sites of molecules that differ in size, shape, and polarizability in Cu-BTC metal organic framework. The cage system of the framework can be exploited to enhance adsorption of small gases. We find that nonpolar molecules adsorb preferentially in the small tetrahedral cages, whereas alcohols and water molecules adsorb close to the copper atoms in one of the big cages. Blocking potentially enhances selective adsorption and separation and we therefore investigate how to block these cages in a practical manner. We propose to use ionic liquids for it and we find that the addition of these components reduces the adsorption of polar molecules near the open metal centers. For this reason, the presence of ionic liquids reduces the attack of the molecules of water to the metallic centers improving the framework stability.},
